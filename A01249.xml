            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

For Sathan had so sowed this error, (a subtill tricke of that olde Nouatian, and Angel like Deuill,) in almost all the religious and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the lande, that religion it selfe seemed to liue, and to die therewith. Yea my selfe, before authority inforced mee with <hi>Lynceus</hi> eyes to looke into this opinion of theirs, was so farre carried with the regard thereof, that I rather chose to erre with such men, then to thinke the trueth with the present estate: the very reuerence of the men, made me to reuerence the verie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the men, and then no meruaile if I did easily consent to ouerthrow that, which my selfe had once holpen to build vp: But when I saw that howsoeuer I ought to reuerence such men: yet that I ought to reuerence, incomparably more the trueth, and glory of God: When I saw that my long silence, did not redeeme their silence, that the holding of my peace, did not giue them peace: that to be silent did do them no good: but to speake might do them some good, for it might resolue them. When I saw that they were condemned for their error: and my selfe, and my brethren were condemned for the trueth, so that their sincerity could not vphold religion, because of their silenced error: nor our truth, because of mens blind and wilfull, and too too vncharitable erring. When I saw that their false opinion ouerthrew their ministery with the state: &amp; mens false opinions concerning vs ouerthrew our ministerie with the contrary: so that in all places, and euery where, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was like to fall to the ground: I thought it high time now, if euer (not weighing what once I thought, but what now, I plainely see, and knowe) religion it selfe, and the trueth of God so requiring to cleere our selues in the open hearing, and sight of the world, and to let all men know, that we that haue subscribed to the present Church gouerment, haue not done it of humane infirmitie, as they would seeme to thinke, that are the most charitable among them: much lesse haue we done it as temporizers, to raise our selues to worldly honor: or as Apostataes, and turne coates,
<pb facs="tcp:27728:5"/> to enioy the riches, and the fat of the land: but from a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of knowledge, and from tried, and approoued grounds of the worde, which what they are, we offer by this Apology to the view of the world, and to be looked into both by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, and by our friends: not now any longer standing in feare of the enuious man, if as <hi>Vlisses</hi> vnder <hi>Aiax</hi> shield: so I, religion, and the truth of God, (as in most humble wise I craue and most confidently hope,) may be hidden and safe kept, vnder your Lordships most able, and honorable protection. And since I haue ventured so far vpon your Lordships desired, but not deserued fauour, as to become troublesome to you, with the defence, of this my defence: Let it not I beseech you seem vnpleasing or vnseemely in your Lordships eies, if I intreate in the behalfe of our enemy-brethren, that they may haue free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to vse the presse, if they meane to make answere to this Apology and answere of ours. I feare not least these reasons of mine should proue like small wines, that please better in the tasting, then in the drinking. No my very hope is, that if they doe but reade them, they will relish them. But if they shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to dissolue them: they will resolue them, and that they will not finde them to be hay, or straw, or stubble, builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation Christ, but pearle &amp; pretious stone, &amp; pure gold, which the more it is tried, the purer it wil be. And thus my hope is, that by me the weakest &amp; vnablest man of the Church: the Church, and we the condemned men of the Church, may keep our innocency: and our brethren, if they be not obstinate may be resolued, and we with them inioy in the Church, our mutuall, and long wished: but too too long broken, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued peace: which God, who onely is able, and is the Author of peace, by this of mine, or some other more effectuall work, effect and work, in his good, and speedy time, for Iesus Christ his sake, to whome be all honour giuen and euerlasting praise, both now and for euer, Amen.</p>

If thou askest when this change was made, and when this ruling power was translated from the Church to the
<pb facs="tcp:27728:6"/> King: this booke will answere thee, and tel thee, that when Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian, they gained a kingdom on earth, that they lost before euen a kingdom ouer the kingdom of Christ, and besides, a kingdom in heauen, where they that raigne well, being Kings on earth, shall raign also Kings in heauen with Iesus, that Lord and mightie King. If thou askest what word there is to warrant this change: it will shewe thee, that it is warranted by the spirit of Prophecie, that spake in <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet, that foretold, that <hi>Kings should be nursing Fathers, and Queens nursing mothers</hi> to the Church, to feede vs not onely with the word, but the sword: that is, to rule and gouern prudently, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the Church of God. If thou askest the reasons of the change this booke will yeelde thee twenty at the least, to resolue thee of this point: it wil let thee plainly see, that the power to rule, that once was in the Church when Kings were not yet Christians, is now, that Kings are become Christians, departed from the Church, &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uolued to the Christian King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as to the proper owners &amp; right heires of so great a power. And here I must tell thee, that this doctrine, as it hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, that for want of eye-salue, cannot see into the end of the Primitiue gouernment abolished: so it hath many friends, men of a nimbler eye and quicke sight, that dare vphold it with the best member that they haue. And that in one view thou mightest see both the friends and the foes, I will in a word set them before thee. The principall enemy of this doctrine is the Pope, who hauing seazed vpon the Kingdome of Christ, holdeth fast the power, and exerciseth the gouernment of the Church ouer the Kings, and the princes of the earth, and holdeth opinion, that the power that Christ gaue to his Church to gouerne and to rule, is perpetuall, and that it may not be taken away from the Church by any of the kings of the earth. This opinion of his, is seconded by the Brownists, and by our brethren Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that are silenced, because they claime this power as their right in the name of Iesus, and will not yeeld it to the King: as if Kings in this light of the Gospel could be hooded as they were in the dayes of darkenesse. or if Kings that shooke off but lately the yoke of the Pope, would againe put their neckes vnder the yoke of the Eldership<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And though loth, (because we would not be thought to speake for <hi>Baal,</hi>) yet from the bitternesse, and very griefe of our heart, as men weary of hearing, and bearing such things, we haue at last consented, to draw forth out of our secret bosomes, our hidden motiues, and to lay open our priuate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which being secret, kept inward peace; but being not open, haue gotten no good report, And herein dealing plainely, as in the sight of God, we lay open, and vnfold our selues to the world, that our aduersaries sitting as iudge ouer this our cause, might giue sentence ouer vs, according as we shall cleare, or not cleare our selues, by this Apologie, and defence of ours: which that we might the better make, wee must remember according to their two fold accusation, to answere first, (which wee intend if God permit) for our subscription to the present Gouernment: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to answere for our taking vpon vs the vse, of the lawfull, and laudable ceremonies, that by authority a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Such a Gouernment (say they) was there set in the Church of God, by the spirit of God, and by the power of Iesus Christ: and such a Gouernement say they, now is to be set by the same power of God in euery particular Church of the world. And this is that godly shew, and that plausible reason of theirs, whereby we were carried very farre in our affections to imbrace, and incline to that opinion, and iudgement of theirs. Now in a contrary opinion to this, are our reuerent Bishops, the very Fathers of the Church, and the rest, which are the greatest part both of the Vniuersities, &amp; the whole land beside: and these hold that no such Gouernment was in the Church, and yet that albeit such a Gouernement were established in the Primitiue Church, as hath by them beene spoken off: yet the same was not thereby necessarily imposed, vpon this our Church, and all other Churches of the world. Onely that it was for those times, and then necessary, when persecution oppressed the Church: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Christian prince, and in a publique we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And vnto these men, the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall censure of Excommunication, and the power of the Church seemed to be, and was indeede vnto them, of very great power, to keepe them in awe, to restraine them from sinne, and to leade them forth in all the right wayes of God. For these men to be seperate from the brethren, whom they loued as their own soules: to be cast out of the Church, where one day was better then a thousand else-where; where to be a doore-keeper, was better then to be a king in another place, was a heauy cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But this censure of the Church, that was to the brethren, &amp; vnto the Church so terrible, &amp; so fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing, was to the Gentiles, and to the rest that were without, a most contemptible, and dispised thing: it concerned not, nor touched their bodies; and they, of a certainty did not know, that they had soules, it was the binding of them in their sinnes, that were slaues, and vtterly sold vnto sinne: it was a spiritual punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they were carnall men: for them to be shut out of the Church, that despised the Church, and persecuted it: for them to be seperated from the brethren, that of themselues, did seperate themselues from the brethren, and did hate them, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In a word, that which to the beleeuers, was a censure as heauy as death, to these men, was not so much as a slea-biting; and therefore these men were not by the Iudgement of the Apostle, lyable, to the gouernment of the Church. I wrote vnto you (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, in his Epistle to the Corinthians. 5. ver. 9.10 11, 12, 13.) that ye should not company together, with fornicators, and not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the fornicators of this wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ld, or with the couetous, or with extortioners, or with idolaters, for then ye must go out of the world. But now I haue written vnto you, that ye companie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:27728:17"/> not together; if any that is called a brother be a fornicator, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, or an idolater, or a rayler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner with such a one eate not; for what haue I to doe, to iudge them also which are without? Do not you iudge them that are within? But God shall iudge them that are without: where the Apostle plainely sheweth, that the censure of excommunication, did not appertaine to the despising Gentiles, nor the wicked of the world, that were without, and were not, nor could not bee called brethren: for these men were to bee left to the fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God onely, hauing none from the Church that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; nor none from the King that he inflicted: and therfore he permitteth none to be gouerned by the Church, but them that were first within; and secondly were called brethren: so the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of excommunication fitteth none in the Apostles iudgment, but them that were within. Now it is plaine, that the greatest parte of our Church, are no such manner of men: they came not voluntarily vnto the Church, but came by compulsion: they were not specially called, but turned Christians with the King: they haue not so much as a temporary faith, but are drowned as deepe in vnbeleefe, as the very Gentiles were: they make not so much as a profession of the Gospell, but despise the professors and the profession, as much as euer the Gentiles did: they are some of them as grosly ignorant, as euer the Gentiles were: they delight in sinne, and are as prophane, as euer the Gentiles were: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the brethren, the Church, and the censures of the Church, as much as euer the Gentiles did: In a word, in name they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but in deede, and truth, they are Gentiles: and if wee may rightly count him a heathen, that is excōmunicate by the Church: much more may we esteeme so of him, that is excommunicate <hi>ipso facto,</hi> as the law speaketh: That is, that of himselfe, by his notable sinnes, without the immediate authority of the Church, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate person. Now such men as these; who can cal them brethren? And therfore to punish these men by seperating them from the Church, that hold it a punishment to be tyed &amp; brought vnto the Church: to cast out these men from the Church, that desire to be lawfully absent from the Church: to seperate these by excommunication from the brethren, that seperate themselues from them, and flie from them, as from a serpent, and vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise excommunication; is in the iudgement of our aduersaries, a very vnfit thing: and therefore if in the Apostles iudgement, the
<pb facs="tcp:27728:17"/> censure of excōmunication (the very sword of Ecclesiastical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment) pertained only vnto brethren; and the greatest part of our Church are none such: then I cannot see, how that gouernmēt can be thrust of necessity vpon such a people. I confesse, that our prophane men are worthy, and fittemen to be excommunicate, but excommunication fitteth them not, nor is not worthy of them: it is not fitte to giue holy things vnto dogges; not to cast pearles vnto swine; not to set vp the holy gouernment Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, as vpon a Stage to be made contemptible, and despised of the greatest sort of men. And if it be not now fit in the hand of the great men of the Church, armed with the power of the king, and countenanced by him; and that in the eyes of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: how would it be despised among our prophane persons, in the hands of the poore Ministers, and baser men of the Church? And if now it fitteth not our estate, by their owne confession; how would it fit the estate of the Primitiue Church Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And therefore to hold that such a Gouernement, by the will, and commandement of God, is to be set vp ouer such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as by the expresse will and commaundement of God, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from that gouernement; is to hold contraries, things impossible, monstrous absurdities, in very reason: and therefore to conclude this point; I hold, that if there were now (as the Brownists haue begunne, and as it was in the Primitiue Church) a seperation made of the brethren, from the rest of the Prophane; these brethren which would be but a poore few, a small number God wot, might be gouerned by Ecclesiasticall Discipline, with more reason: but the rest, which are the most parte of the land, were vtterly vncapable thereof; and therefore to tie to a people, mixed together, the discipline Ecclesiasticall, is not according to the Apostles rule; nor euer sprang of the holy spirit of God: as there is one King, one Church, one people of all; so there must be a gouernement fitted for all, that may feare all, Christians in name, and Christians in truth; that may gouerne all, and that may be reuerenced of al sorts of men: which cannot be (as the case, and people stand) the gouernement Ecclesiasticall.</p>

For if to rule be as essentiall to the Minister, as it is to preach, and to minister the Sacraments, then it is as notable a sinne in the Ministers to omit ruling, as it is to omit preaching, then let them looke to this.</p>

               <p>If to rule be of the essence of the Minister, then the same power being iointly, and in equall manner, in the lay Elder, the name of the Minister, (which is euer giuen by the form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To punish sinne is an essentiall part of the Kings office: if thou doe euill (saith the Apostle to the Romanes, Chap 13.4.) Feare, for the King beareth not the sword in vaine.

And seeing they see it to be a part of the princely, and no part of the Priestly office of Christ: how is it, that they doe not see it to bee much lesse any part of their Priestly, or ministeriall function? and being they see it to be no part of their ministeriall office, but a part of the Kingly office of Christ, which is put ouer to the Kings and Princes of the Church: how is it, that not contented with their ministeriall function, they desire, nay dare, to take vpon themselues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with a Kingly office, and incroach vpon the office of the King, whereunto (it being no part of their calling) they haue no extraordinary calling by God, in these our dayes of peace, nor ordinarie, by the Church by God? And being they see it to be a matter accidentall, befalling the minister extraordinarily, as the fittest man to gouerne the persecuted Church, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and totall want of the Christian King: how is it, that they see it not as an accident of that nature, to be lawfully absent from them, vnder a godly King? And then if vnder a godly King, it may lawfully be absent from the Minister, that claimeth a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all interest therein: much more may it be lawfully absent from the inferior flocke, and the lay people, from out of whom the lay Elders were taken: and therefore can claime a lesser interest therein, then their superiour Ministers: which are in this case eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way priuiledged aboue them. If then it may bee wanting in the Minister and in his flocke, then it may be wanting in that one Church, then in euery one; and if it may be wanting in the parts, then the same being the reason of the whole, and the parts, it may be wholy wanting in the whole Church, that is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by a godly King.</p>

                  </gap>ut by the ciuill magistrate, and by power meerely ciuill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of <hi>Moyses.</hi> But when persecution raged in the Iewish Church, when the kingdome was departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and a law-giuer from betweene his legges, when straungers rose vp, &amp; bore rule, that feared not God, nor looked to the execution of iustice, according to the law of God: then for want of other Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices, and Iusticers, rose vp the <hi>Sannedrim:</hi> to bridle by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, (which onely were left free for them lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vse) the lesser sinnes so accounted: for as for the greater which were punished by the Kings of the Gentiles, them they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled not with. Then wee read that the high Priests had determined to vse excommunication, (a thing neuer before heard of among the Iewes) against them that beleeued in Christ. Whence it appeareth that Ecclesiasticall Discipline sorted not with godly and Christian Kings, that it stood not with the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able estate of the Church, and that it was no ordinary kinde of Gouernement: but altogether extraordinarie, accompaning the troubled, and persecuted estate of the Church. And as it neuer was in vse during the time of the godly Kings: so neither could it, nor should it haue beene in vse, had the like godly rulers still carried the sway in the Iewish Church. For that pollicie of God that was for the former times, and vnder the former kings, all sufficient for the absolute Gouernement of the Iewish estate: should haue bene vnder the like, for after times, as suffiicient for the absolute gouerning of them: and therefore being as sufficient for those latter, as for the former times, it should haue bene as needlesse in the last dayes, as it was in the first: and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:27728:20"/> as well haue bene wanting in the latter dayes, as it was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: and so, as a needlesse Gouernement, in the full light of the former all sufficient, haue beene still put out, and wholly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Ecclesiasticall estate of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>And yet further it is confested by our brethren, that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Gouernement by them so desired, is in effect the same, that the Iewish persecuted Church, gouerned by the <hi>Sanneorita,</hi> first brought into vse: which being so, plainely sheweth, that the Ecclesistaical Discipline was not first brought into the Church by the power of Iesus Christ. Neither was it then set vp as a parcell of the Kingdome of Christ. Neither was held as any part of the Gospell of Christ: for it was brought into the Church before the father had giuen all power to his sonne in heauen, and in earth, before hee had receiued as yet the kingdome. Yea before the dayes of the Gospell: yea before Christ Iesus was as yet come in the flesh. And therefore it was not brought into the Church, first by Christ as our brethren would seeme to beleeue, and perswade vs with them to beleeue, as the power of Iesus, for the perpetuall Gouernement of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the Church: but it was first brought in by the Iewish Church, in the mere want of the other Gouernement of God, by the Gentile Kings by strong hand with-held. Seeing therefore that this Ecclesiasticall Discipline was neuer brought in by <hi>Moyses,</hi> the first law-giuer: nor yet at the first by Christ, the second law-giuer: nor neuer in vse in all the dayes of the godly Iewish kings: no nor neuer should haue beene in vse in all their peaceable estate: And in that it came first into the Church in the persecuted estate thereof, and when all godly kings were vtterly taken away and wanting: It must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that onely very necessitie, and the want of godly kings to gouerne the Church, first, brought it into the Church of God.</p>
               <p>And this will the better appeare, if we looke into the Primitiue Church, where this Ecclesiasticall Discipline was in the greatest vse: for in that it will more manifestly appeare, that meere neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity there set it vp; for there was thē a Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a body. A bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if it keepe his good constitution, must be gouerned well: this body therefore of the Church that it might be well; must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned well: that it might be gouerned well, there must be good gouernours, and good lawes, by the which the gouernours must
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:27728:20"/> gouerne well, this good and well composed body of Christ. But where should they haue gouernours to looke to this body of God? The Kings and Princes of the earth, the ordinary rulers to whom it belonged, refused it; and all the Gentill rulers refused it; ordinary rulers therefore there were not any to bee had: Nay, where should they haue rulers Christian for the body of Christ? Should they, or could they fetch them from Gentile, and Heathen Kings? There was vtterly then a want of all ordinary rules, and rulers for the gouernement of this body Ecclesiastical, which was the Church of Christ; the ordinary therefore being wanting, Christ extraordinarily from heauen reached them foorth lawes, and raised them vp gouernors extraordinary from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their ruling Pastors, or chosen Elders: and withall, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands a sword Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall (excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation I mean) which he borrowed of the former Iewish Church. And to make it exceeding sharpe, he tyed thereunto a curse, far more fearefull then temporall death: and thus in the want of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, Christ for those dayes raised vp extraordinary rulers, to gouerne the body of the Church; all which plainely speaketh, that for the very want of the ordinary Magistrate to gouerne the Church, the Ecclesiasticall gouernment sprung vp first And for the better beholding of this, consider, I pray you, what sinnes the Apostle in the fift to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> chargeth the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth to censure by excommunication, and you shall finde them to be idolatrie, adulterie, couetousnesse, extortion, rayling, and drunkennesse: all which to bee no sinnes, the Heathen Gentiles were fully perswaded, or at the least sinnes of that small account, as that the Kings and rulers of the Heathen needed not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle therewith. All which I could well proue out of Heathen Authors, if I thought that any man would once make a question thereabout. These sinnes then being not punished by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Kings, must of necessity bee punished by rulers of the Church, or else it must be left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ree for the men of the Church to runne without bridle into these notable sinnes: had the ordinary Magistrate therefore punished these sinnes, as they did the other, that they counted the grosser sinnes, the extraordinary Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of the Church should not haue needed no more to punish those lesser sinnes then they needed to haue punished the other which were the greater; for why did not the Church as well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the greater sinnes as the lesser? was it not because the ciuill
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:27728:21"/> Kings did that? The want therefore of the ciuill Gouernement brought in, and set a foote the Ecclesiasticall: This want therfore being taken away, and the ordinary godly King being set in the Chuch of God, the procreant cause of their Ecclesiastical gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is vtterly taken away; and so the ground-worke and pillar thereof being taken away, it must needes, as the Philistims house pulled downe by <hi>Sampson,</hi> fall vtterly to the ground: and if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this his first, his right and his iust cause it standeth; without any right, iust or necessary cause it standeth in the Church of God: the Christian Magistrate is not taken out, and therefore no cause now is, as then was, to bring Ecclesiasticall Discipline in.</p>

                  </gap>ine body of the Church, as it stood in grosse, in his first and Primitiue times; and I see that it was a kind of body, cleane differing from that which now it is: for in regard of the multitude of beleeuers whereof it confisted, it was called a pure body, but now there be many open sinners therein: then the Church was a body simple, of it selfe: absolute without any composition; but when it came vnder a Christian King that brought with him a Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, of people al vnbeleeuing before then it did manifestly dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into another nature; and of a simple, became a compound body; for both the Church and the Common-wealth, grew into one compound body: mixed together of the Church, and the weale publique, the visible head whereof was the King: which being but in a word spoken, I desire at large to lay open to euerie mans view; and therefore I boldly auouch, that in the Primitiue time there was a plaine difference, and an open seperation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Common-wealth and the Church they were as two seuerall Cities; the one heauenly, the other altogether earthly. And as two diuers Cities, they had their two diuers regiments: they were as two diuers standing campes, hauing their seuerall Generals, their seuerall Collonels, their seuerall Captaines, and their seuerall Standard bearers; they were as two seuerall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, hauing their seuerall Lawes and constitutions, their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kings and vnder-officers; they had their diuers Gods, their diuers faith, their diuers rites and ceremonies, their diuers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, their diuers religions and worshippings of God, their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:27728:21"/> diuers members, their diuers companies, their diuers and seuerall places for Church-assemblies, their diuers officers and rulers se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall, differing one from the other. In Ierusalem, there was the Church of Christ, gouerned by the Apostles, the Euangelists, and the Elders of the Church, and this was one body: Againe in the same Ierusalem, there was <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> the high Priests, the Scribes, and Pharises, together with the rest of the vnbeleeuing Iewes. and this was another bodie, hauing another head, another spirit, and other kind of members. But now, especially with vs, this diuision and seperation betweene the Church, and the weale publique, is vtterly abolished, and taken away; the King doth not diuide himselfe from the Minister; nor the Common-weale doth not seperate it selfe from the Church; neither are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-weale one, and the members of the Church another: they haue not their seueral Churches, their seueral Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, their seuerall professions, their seuerall rites, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; they are not disiomed in their God, in their faith, in their spirit, in their bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sme, in their body, in their head: the King commeth to the Church, and the Church commeth to the King: they ioyne together in one Church in one God, in one faith, in one baptisme, in one spirit, in one Christ, in one holy profession, in one body: they are all builded as Ierusalem, that is at vnity in itselfe: they are all one army; the hoast of the great God: they are all one Kingdome; and that is the Kingdome of Christ: all the members of the Church, are the members of the Common-weale: and all the members of the Common-weale, are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; the same with vs, is the Common-weale and the Church: al the people are as the people of the Iews; a holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō, a royal Priesthood, a kingly people, by profession &amp; baptisme. And albeit there be with vs a multitude of cast-awaies, that to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery good worke are reprobate; yet these make not a diuers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for in the visible Church there be Goates as well as Sheepe; chaffe as well as corne, cockle as well as wheate; and yet but one Church: Yea, there be diuers offices, and seuerall functions; some spirituall, some temporall and yet but one body. In the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale there be some Counsellers, some Chancellers, some Iudges some Iustices, some Captaines, and one King; and yet these diuers offices make not a diuers body politique. In the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, there were some spirituall Ministers, some Lay Elders (as they say) some Deacons for the poore, and some aged
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:27728:22"/> Widdowes; and yet but one body Ecclesiasticall. In the body of a man there be diuers seuerall parts, hauing seuerall functions; there is the mouth, there is the nose, there are the eyes and the hands, there is the flesh that is earthly, and the spirits that are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly; and yet all make not two bodies, but one body: In a man there is his visible, and materiall body, and his spirituall soule; and yet these diuers natures make not two, but one man. There are in the Parliament that representeth the whole estate, the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses of the lower house, the Lords temporall, and the spirituall Lordes, and there is one King the head of all this body: the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery is a seuerall calling; but it maketh not now a seueral state, a seueral body, as it did in the Primitiue times, but it is coupled with the Weale publique, and groweth with it into one body, vnder one head, which is the Christian King, as once did the whole Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish estate vnder <hi>Dauid</hi> their head and King: and thus the whole Kingdome of the land, is become the Kingdome of Christ, and the Kingdome of Christ, is the kingdome of the land, which could not be said of the Primitiue Church. And thus of two states before the faith, they are become one state in the faith: of two bodies before, they are growne into one newe body<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much differing euery way, from the Ecclesiasticall bodie of the Primitiue Church. For now this new body, comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to composition with the Weale publique, hath therby receiued a member, higher, and nobler then the former visible head; and that which in the new making of this body must not be set below the former head, but according to his highnes, be placed aloft, and be made the head of this new composed body: and this eminent member, excelling the head of the former visible Church, is the Christian King, who, as we all subscribe, is become the head of this our English Church. This body therefore must needes be chaunged, for it hath changed his head, the very maine and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall parte of the body: for the head of the Primitiue Church were the Apostles, and after them the Bishops (as we say) (the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershippe, as our brethren say) but the head of this Church is the King, as we all say: Yea, with the new head, answerable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable thereunto; it hath receyued other, and new organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call members, I meane the Nobles and the Peeres of the land; the Councell and the Chanceller of the Kings; the Captaines of warre, and the Iudges of the land: all which beeing once the members organicall of the Common-weale, are now with their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:27728:22"/> head, become the members organicall of our English Church▪ seruing euery one of them, as hands directed by their own head, to defend the faith, to maintaine the Gospell, to vphold the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, and puritie of Christian Religion, the profession, and the Preaching of the word of God. Yea to beat downe all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Gospell, by the power of the sword: whether they be forraine, in other lands, or the domesticall enemies of the church: whither they be the disobedient in life, or erronious in doctrine. Aduetie once belonging to the Eldership; but now made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them: which thing was not so in the Primitiue Church: and that which is more, all the lawes of the land, are in right the lawes of the Church, and the Ecclesiasticall lawes, are the kings Ecclesiasticall lawes: &amp; no longer the lawes proper to the church; and all the rulers of the Church, are at the kings pleasure, to attend the affaires of the commonweale. And that which is yet a farther point; this new formed body hath receiued not only new organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call members: but other inferior members, of lesser &amp; baser note: in their very nature differing frō the ancient &amp; proper members of the Primitiue Church: members, led with another spirit, and moued with another spirit, (and therefore to be gouerned with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother spirit) then those of the Primitiue Church. For there were no visible members, but such as came thereunto by a speciall calling: being wonne thereunto, and brought thither, by the power of the Gospel, and mighty worke of the spirit. But now there is a great number added vnto our Church, that neuer came by any speciall calling; but onely for company came, and turned of necessitie with the king their head: men (their baptisme onely excepted) vtterly irreligious, and heathen, and nothing like vnto the auncient members of the auncient Primitiue Church. And these are they that astonish and amaze our brethren, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters especially, as not knowing what to say vnto them, how to rule them, how to deale with them, how to Minister vnto them the Lords Supper. These are to them heteroclites, that is men out of their rule, and without the compasse of their carde; to admit them to the Lords Supper they are afraid, for they iudge them not worthy; and to cast them out of the Church they dare not, least they should iumpe with the Brownists, that would cut them off, and throw them out of the Church againe, and set them in that their old place, wherein they stood before their comming for company with the king: and then as they shall be called special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:27728:23"/> so to receiue them into the Church, as the Primitiue Church did: that the members of this Church, and that, might bee alike. For herein they plainely, and truely see; the members of this Church, and the members of the Primitiue Church, do differ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly: and thereby giue vs, and all to vnderstand: that these must bee gouerned by other rulers, then those of the Primitiue Church: and by other rulers, then the Eldership: euen by that head, whereof they are members, and that head is the king; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that this bodie is of a simple, become a compound; and hath receiued more members, and that of another bodie, and of another sort and kind; and hath receiued another head, and so is become a new, and another kind of body, then that of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church: It followeth, that this new body must not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with the old forme of the Primitiue Church, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with another, and a new forme. For this is euer vsuall, and euer constant, in the whole course of nature, and in euery worke of God, to giue vnto a new body, another, and a new forme, to gouerne and rule it by. See it in man, whom God made of the clay of the ground; and yet is not ruled by the forme of the ground, but by the breath which the Lord breathed into the face of man: which is another forme, differing cleane from that of the earth. All the trees, and plants of the earth, God made to grow and to spring out of the earth; and to euery one of these, he gaue his diuerse forme: the tree of life had his, the tree of knowledge had his, the rose hath his, the violet hath his; yea euery bird of the aire, made of the aire, hath his; euery fish of the sea, hath his forme diuerse from the sea; the Whale hath his, the Salmon hath his, the Carpe hath his, the Pike hath his: yea the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being simple, haue their simple, and their seuerall formes. But comming into composition, they loose and let goe their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall formes; &amp; submit themselues to another, &amp; a new forme: the Mouse that is made of the slime of the Egyptian <hi>Nilus,</hi> liueth not by the forme of the <hi>Nilus</hi> slime; nor the Bee, that is made of the heyfer, is not ruled by the forme of the heyfer; nor the Worme that is bred of man, liueth not by the reasonable soule of man, euery new body hath to rule it, a new forme.

               <p>ANd heere, the better to shew this new chaunge, in this new body, I will offer to your consideration the particular changeable partes, of the Primitiue changeable, and chaunged Church-Gouernement: and herein first I will let you see, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, the very sword, the scepter, and power of the Primitiue Church Gouernment, is in the iudgement of all, to be exchanged with other more effectuall coercions, in this cōfused, and mixed Church of ours. And as for the Iudgement of the King, the Iudgement of the Counsell of the land, and the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the learned fathers of the land, it appeareth, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is extant, which his excellent maiestie had, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his honourable, gratious, and wise counsell, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent Fathers, the Lord Bishops of the land: that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, insteede of excommunication, to set vp some other coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that had in it, a more effectuall power to redresse and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse sinne. It seemed no doubt vnto their wisedomes, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable thing, that the vnbeleeuing part, that were with the ancient Kings of the land turned Protestants, should againe by excommunication bee cast out of the Church: but rather that they should bee brought vnto the Church: whether they were brought, and whether they came to bee taught. by the Church. It seemed no vnlawfull thing vnto them, to exchange excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, the weighty censure of the Church, with other more effectuall: but this rather seemed vnto them, an vnlawfull thing, to make contemptible the holy censure Ecclesiasticall:
<pb facs="tcp:27728:24"/> or to vse, or rather abuse the auncient censure of the Church, to ouerthrow the Church, &amp; the spredding of the Church; &amp; to the making of a Schisme in the Church: and a separation, betweene the Church againe, &amp; the Common-weale, as the Brownists do; and so to the ouerthrowing againe of the vnion: &amp; by the meanes of the Church, that, other Kings, &amp; God by other Kings, had buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: &amp; therfore that it were better, that excommunication should be thrust, &amp; shut out the Church, then that excomunication shold thrust and shut out the Church: and that the vse of it could not stand, nor as it was once, be now put i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on sleeping, some other fit censure, meerely Ciuill, should be put in vse, that should gouerne the beleeuing, &amp; the vnbeleeuing part: &amp; further altogether, &amp; no whit impaire, or impeach the growth, &amp; good estate of the whole Church, as now it standeth. And as for our aduersaries: themselues hold (as appeareth by their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, &amp; by their often suits to the Parliament) that excōmuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the only censure Ecclesiasticall, in the cases of adulterie, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, Heresie▪ &amp; such like, as being too light, vnder a Christian king, is to be exchanged with death. So that in the iudgement of all, excōmunication the principall part of Ecclesiasticall Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a matter changeable, vnder a Christian prince. If then the principal part therof be changeable, no questiō, but the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmēt it self is chāgeable, &amp; altogether mutable, as wel as that is</p>
               <p>And heere I hope, that our aduersaries will easily graunt, that these men were not ignorant of the power of Iesus, and the gift of the keyes, bestowed by Iesus vpon the Church. All which power notwithstanding, and gift of the keyes, they saw, and that wisely, and truely, that the sword of excommunication might be closed vp in his sheath, and as a needlesse one, be laid aside; vnder a godly and Christian king. For the gift of Christ doth not make excommunication perpetuall vnto the Church. Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending vp on high, saith the Apostle, led captiuitie captiue, and gaue gifts vnto men; and the gifts that he gaue, are there rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned vp by the Apostle: he gaue some Apostles, some Prophets, some Euangelists, &amp;c. And: yet notwithstanding the gift of the Apostles, Apostles are ceased, and Prophets, notwithstanding the gift of Prophets, are ceased, and Euangelists, notwithstanding
<pb facs="tcp:27728:25"/> the gifts of Euangelists are ceased: and the key of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithstanding the gift of that key may surcease vnder a Christian king. The office of the high Priest was giuen by God vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his seede, by a perpetull decree, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the perpetuity thereof, by expresse words, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>Aaron</hi> by God himselfe, the Priest-hood was altered with the law, and transferred to another, euen to Iesus, that was of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> by an euerlasting decree of God. Much more excommunication being tied to the Church by no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall decree of God, or of Christ, may bee altered with the visible estate of the Church, and may bee taken away from the peaceable, that was giuen to the persecuted Church of Christ. Who knoweth not that there are gifts temporary, and eternall; for liues, and for euer: estates onely for certaine termes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuities. Especially, that vnder offices are arbitrary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable from person to person, at the pleasure of the high and chiefe Lord and king, Iesus.</p>
               <p>But be it that excommunication by the gift of Christ is affixed to the Church by a perpetuall decree, so that it may not be taken vtterly away: yet the vse of it may be discontinued, though the right, and interest therein, doe abide perpetually in the Church, For the gift of it to the Church by Christ, doth not binde the Church vnseasonably, or without vrgent, and iust cause to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vse this power, or to draw out the sword of excommunication: euen as the word, &amp; the gift of the Sacraments, by Christ bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And thus you see vpon how weake principles, and vnsound ground, our brethren build the necessitie, and perpetuall vse of excommunication in the Church: and thus you see, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the gift of the keyes, which is their maine proofe, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:27728:26"/> in all those causes, now sitteth the King, and the officers vnder the King, as Iudges, to giue righteous iudgement therein. To him therefore comming into the Church, the ruling Elder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, and gaue vp his sword: To him, and to his rule, the church that before was vnder the Eldershippe, submitted it selfe; and looked, and waited for iustice, from his handes: of the Primitiue Church one of the fathers said, that the Church knewe nothing greater therein then the Bishoppe, but wee know one greater then the Bishopp, euen the sacred person, and power of the king. For doe you suppose, that when the King came to the Church, that then there came but a priuate person, that was to be vnder the rule and power of the Church, and to be topped by the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe? I tell you noe: he came a publique person, to rule, and to take into his hand, out of the hand of the Elders, the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church of God; to gouerne them, that before were gouerning Elders, to gouerne all them, that before were gouerned by the Elders: yea, and to gouerne them in the same cases, and in all the same affaires, wherein they were gouerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the ruling Elders of the Church. There is therefore ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruler sprung vp in the Church, and that planted by God, that the Primitiue Church neuer knew: and that is the King, that hath authority from God to rule there, and a sword for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose giuen him of God: as the Elders before him had authority to rule there, and a speciall sword giuen vnto them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from God The King therfore now is to gouerne the church by his power, and to be <hi>Custos virius{que} tabulae:</hi> which is all that the ruling Elders had to doe in the Primitiue Church. And this is so apparant, that it cannot be denied: the light hereof shineth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our enemies, and they confesse the King to be such a one indeede. The Lord that before put Pastors and Elders in trust with his body, which is the Church, and committed the rule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into their hands, hath now in stead of them, made choice of more excellent guardians: euen of the Kings, and Princes of the world, and hath committed to their trust, the same body of his, that before he put into the hands, and custody of the ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: and of these dayes, and of this change, spake the Prophet before, forewarned thereof, by the spirit, and forewarning vs thereof by the spirit of God, saying, thou shalt sucke the breasts of Kings, and Princes shall giue thee milke, Esa. 60.10.16.

The holy man of God therefore, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And indeed by necessary consequent it followeth, that if by God there be set vp a new kinde of ruler, with a new kind of sword, to rule the Church withall: then there must needes be set vp a new kind of rule, a new sword, a newe scepter, a new gouernement, in the whole Church of God: and so euery part of the Primitiue gouernement, being changed, the whole of nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And here I must admonish our aduersaries of three thinges; first that the common distinction of the ciuill, and the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sword, doth not destroy, nor ouerthrow this argument of mine: for though the King may not rule with the Ecclesiasticall sword, whereof he hath no neede; yet he may as sufficiently rule the Church with his ciuill sword, without the Ecclesiasticall; as the Ecclesiasticall ruler could gouerne it, with his Ecclesiasticall sword, without the ciuill: yea, in stead of destroying of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it doth strengthen it more; for in that they confesse that the King may gouerne the Church by his ciuill sword: the bringing in of that argueth the throwing out of the other: the setting vp
<pb facs="tcp:27728:27"/> of that, argueth the pulling downe of the other: euen as the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in of the new law of Christ, argued the disanulling, of the old law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Apostle reasoneth to the Hebrewes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the distinction of the ciuill, and Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, doth not dissolue this argument of mine. For though the king be not a meere Ecclesiasticall person; yet we haue made a question of it, and proued, that being but a ciuill person, he may for gouernement in the Church, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e all that the Ecclesiasticall Elders might doe: for he is now, what they were before. Hee is now, as they were once, <hi>custos vtrius{que} tabulae:</hi> that is, the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eyther table of the Law. And here it is now too late to runne in a ring, and to runne backe to the distinction of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall sword, and the ciuill; which to preuent, we haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away that before. It is enough for vs, that hee may doe the same, being a ciuill Magistrate, that the Church elder might doe before; though he may not doe it, the same way, nor with the same manner of instrument. For what helpeth it them, or what hurteth it vs, to say, that the King may gouerne as the Elder did, and in stead of him? marry he must not doe it with a leaden dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but with a bright and a sharpe two edged sword, of steele: he may not gouerne the Church with the blunt sword of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, but with the guilded, shining, glittering, and in ameled sword of ciuill iustice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I admonish our aduersaries, that the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, is not principally, about the censures of the Primitiue Church, which they denie not, but that we doe enioy; But the maine question is about the persons, that should censure the Church, and the manner or kinde of censures to bee vsed in the Church Gouernement: the persons that should censure the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Aske of me (saith the father, to his king Christ, set downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his holy hill, Psal. 2.8, 9. That is, residing in Ierusalem that is aboue, euen at the right hand of his father) and I will giue thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the vttermost partes of the earth for thy possession. His kingdome then is ouer all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth: Yea, ouer the very Heathen: and it is not, as the Church is, shut vp in a little corner of the earth: but stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe to the furthermost parts of the earth: and that not to gouerne them as his Church, by his word and spirit; but with an iron rodde to breake them in peeces like a Potters vessell; not like his children, whom being broken, he healeth againe by his owne blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> notably defineth the very breadth, and length, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the exceeding largenesse of the kingdome of Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.8.9.10.11. His Dominion, saith he, shall be from one sea, to the other: from the floods, round about vnto the ends of the world. Before him shall the Barbarians bow themselues; his enemies shall licke the dust, the Kings of the Oceane, and the Islands, shall bring him gifts: the Kings of <hi>Sheba,</hi> and <hi>Seba,</hi> shall doe him seruice. Finally all Kings shall bow themselues to him; all Nations shall doe him seruice. What can be more plainely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his kingdome ouer all Churches, and Realmes, Iewes, and Gentiles, yea ouer all the world, I cannot possibly see, or imagine.</p>
               <p>There is a kingdome ascribed vnto Christ, that is an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting kingdome, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. &amp; 7.14. Thy throne O God, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> (speaking of Christ) is for all ages world with out end. And there is a kingdome ascribed vnto Christ, that he shall resigne againe to his father, and that shall haue an end. Then commeth the end, saith the Apostle, when he shall deliuer vp the kingdome to God the father. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. That king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that shall haue no end, is ouer his saued, and redeemed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Ouer whom, being his bodie, Christ shall euer abide the head.
<pb facs="tcp:27728:28"/> yea after the vniuersall dissolution of the world. <hi>Ergo,</hi> that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that shalbe resigned, being another, differing frō this, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be that his kingdome that is only ouer his bodie, the Church: but it must be that his vniuersall kingdome ouer his enemies. As it is said, he must raigne, till he haue put all all his enemies vnder his feet: his kingdome therfore, and that which shall haue an end, is ouer his friends to saue them, and ouer his enemies, to destroy them.</p>
               <p>It is a part of his kingdome, to raise from dead, and bring into iudgement all flesh, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. and ouer them, as a King, to sit in his glorious throne, and iudgement seat, and pronounce a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence irreuocable of life, or death euerlasting. But this power to iudge, is ouer all Nations; yea ouer quicke, and dead: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, and rose againe, that he might be Lord ouer quicke, and dead. <hi>Ergo,</hi> His kingdome is as large as his iudgement is, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2. Which is ouer more, then ouer his Church: and far larger, then his office of mediation is, for he is the Sauiour of his Church, but iudge of all.</p>
               <p>Because hee humbled himselfe saith <hi>Paul,</hi> to the death of the Crosse: therefore he hath a name, (that is a power, and authority giuen him) aboue all names (whither they be the names of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or of Common-weales: whither they be the names of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, or Kings) that at the name of Iesus all knees should bow: of things in heauen, and things in earth, &amp; things vnder the earth. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.8.9.10. He meaneth that God hath giuen him a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ouer all Angels, ouer all Diuels, ouer all Churches, and Common-weales: ouer all things on the earth, bee they men, or others.</p>
               <p>Else how should hee bee the fift Monarch of the earth, that should take to himselfe the kingdome from the rest of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and giue it to the high Saincts. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14.27. and 2.34.35.44.</p>
               <p>The Angel told his mother <hi>Marie,</hi> that vnto him should bee giuen the kingdome of his father <hi>Dauid, Luke</hi> 1.32.33. But the kingdome of <hi>Dauid</hi> did not gouerne the Church onely, but the weale publike; the gouernement therefore of the kingdome of Christ, reacheth not onely to the Church, but to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale: else the kingdome of Christ, is not as ample, as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Dauid</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Thou art a Priest, saith God to his Christ, after the order of
<pb facs="tcp:27728:29"/>
                  <hi>Melchisedech; Heb.</hi> 7.1. But <hi>Melchisedech</hi> was King of Salem, a little Citie of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Priest of the strong high God, such a one therefore must Christ be: euen a ruler, not onely ouer the Church; but a king ouer the weale publique: or else the shadow shall be greater then the body.</p>
               <p>The time would faile me, if I should stand to alleage all the proofes pregnant in the Scripture, to giue witnesse to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie in hand, these are all sufficient, to let our aduersaries see, that not onely the Church is the kingdome of Christ: but weales publike are a part of the kingdome of, Christ, as wel as Churches are: and that his kingdome is ouer all, both Churches, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales. So ample and so large, the kingdome of Christ is; howsoeuer our aduersary-brethren, (that of all men would seeme most desirous to set vp the Kingdome of Christ, to their greater sin, &amp; to the great dishonoring of Christ, vpon small reason God wot) denie this. But by this it appeareth, that faining to bee the greatest friends of that their Master and Lord Christ, they betray him, and the greatest part of his kingdome: which with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, they conspire to take away frō him, &amp; to yeeld vp again into the hands of the father; that before had yeelded this into the hands of his first begotten, and beloued, the heire of this world, and all worlds to come: and going about to establish their owne kingdome, they destroy the kingdome of Christ, and labouring to inlarge their owne Dominion, and rule, they curtaile and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the kingdome of the Lord Christ. And therefore I cannot but in the zeale of my Lord, and king Christ, bid defiance vnto, and wage battell with this their opinion, that denieth the kingdome of my Lord and king Iesus. And hold him, if it were an Angell from heauen, accursed, that should preach me another Gospell then this that I haue receiued, from the mouthes, and liuely voices of all the holy Scriptures, consenting to this all in one, that Iesus is the king, and Lord ouer all things.</p>
               <p>But I see what droue them to this, and made them run into this foule starting hole, they desired to sit their doctrine of the kingdome of Christ to their opinion of Ecclesiasticall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therfore indeede they fitted their sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e according to their foote. For teaching their Ministers, and Elders, to be the onely officers of Christ to rule the Church, which is the kingdome of Christ; of necessitie, they must except the king from being any officer of the kingdome of Christ. That they might do this: first
<pb facs="tcp:27728:29"/> they warily teach, that the kingdome of Christ is onely ouer his Church: and secondly, that they might not offend the Christian kings, they giue them, as they would seeme to thinke, a higher place: and that they might remoue them out of the kingdome of Christ, and out of all office in the Church of Christ, and so haue elbow roome enough for themselues, they giue them their place immediatly vnder God the Father: and set them to raigne in common-weales: that they might not intermeddle with the Church Gouernement.</p>
               <p>And answerable hereunto, they teach, that the kingdome of Christ is a spirituall kingdome; that is, gouerned by spirituall men, and by spirituall meanes, that is, the word, and the censures Ecclesiasticall: that they might exclude the sword, and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures ciuill out of the Church of Christ, and make it glad to stand armed at the Church doore, to keepe them in safetie, and peace, dominering within, in the Church: and this is all the power they giue to the ciuill king, in gouerning the Church of Christ, and this is good Poperie indeed.</p>
               <p>Although all this geere will not hold, for to gouerne the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall kingdome of Christ, they call in meere lay men: and giue them place, and power, and office, in the kingdome of Christ, and call them by the name of Church Elders: and how will they then shut out the king, being a person more interessed in the Church gouernement, then any of his subiects, from being an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the Church, &amp; kingdome of Christ, and that only for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no spirituall person, but a lay man? at the least let him be as capeable of office in the Church, as his vnder subiects, your cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Elders, be.</p>
               <p>Nay, how stand together these two doctrines of theirs? That the King should not bee an Officer of the Kingdome of Christ: but the Officer of the Father: and yet as they subscribe, bee supreame Gouernour in the Church, which is not the kingdome of the Father, as they say, but the kingdome of the sonne Christ? Can the king bee the Gouernour of the Church, which is the Kingdome of Christ, as they subscribe: and yet be no officer of the Church, as they teach? Is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the Church, no Officer of the Church? can the king be the Vice-roy of the father, whose kingdome the Church is not, as they teach, and yet gouerne the kingdome of Christ; which is not the kingdome, as they say, of the father, but of the son;
<pb facs="tcp:27728:30"/> and yet be no officer of the kingdome of the sonne Christ nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? can the Chauncellour of king <hi>Iames,</hi> our Soueraigne Lord, be the Chauncellour of the Romane Empire, and yet not depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that office by the Emperour? or can the Chauncellour of England, be the Chauncellour of Spaine, and yet not substituted by the king of Spaine? or can the Vice-roy of Spaine, bee the Vicegerent of the king of England, and yet not receiue this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and power from the king of England? Fie, what stuffe is here? what trash, what hay and stubble is heere, built vpon the foundation of gold? or what (to reconcile these their contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) shall we say, that the father is supreame Gouernour ouer common-weales, and that the king is his substitute to gouerne that: and that the sonne is supreame gouernour ouer Churches, and that the king is his Deputie also for him to gouerne that? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thus we shall reconcile them: but then we shall vndoe them▪ for this distinction then will do them no good. For it will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (as faine by this they would) the king, from being an officer of the Church of Christ, it will vtterly cast downe that their strong hold, that holdeth the Ministers, &amp; the Elders, to be the only Church officers: &amp; thus, either, their doctrine must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their subscription: or if these disagree not, they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that kings, &amp; princes, be aswell the officers of the Church, as the Ministers, or lay Elders be: and that they must rule it as well with their sword, as the Elders with their sword: &amp; therfore, that the Church may aswell be gouerned by the ciuill sword, without the Ecclesiasticall: as it was once gouerned by the Ecclesiasticall, without the ciuill. Yea if we shall thus reconcile them, they must be driuen to confesse, that this their distinction, is friuolous, and therfore cast it away, as a vaine one, which neither doth them any good, nor our cause any harme at all, only it seperateth, and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the father, &amp; the son, in their raigne, &amp; kingdome: &amp; disioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them asunder, like two earthly kings; hauing either of them one kingdome seuerall to himselfe: the one sharing the Church for his kingdome, and the other sharing Common-weales for his kingdome. Yea it distracteth vs, for it teacheth vs, that we are not all subiects vnto one king, which is Christ: nor all to one God, which is the father: some be the subiects of the father, and some of vs bee the subiects of the sonne: those of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, are the subiects of the father, and those of the Church, are the subiects of Christ. (Now I pray you whither bee greater the
<pb facs="tcp:27728:30"/> people of the Common-weale, that be the subiects of the father: or the people of the Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h, that be the subiects of Christ?) And no maruell if this doctrine of diuision, (which dooth not subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the one, vnder the other; the sonne vnder the father: but doth deuide in two the kingdomes, and the kings of heauen) doe make diuision, and deuide asunder the kings and the people of the earth.</p>
               <p>And thus hauing cast downe that their strong hold, that stood in our way, we will goe on with the maine force of our argument, and inferre, that the Kingdome of Christ, reaching not ouer Churches only, but ouer Common-weales too, for the fit gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, shall neede not onely censures ecclesiasticall, as our brethren beleeue, which will fit onely the members of the Church: but beside these coertions ciuill, and meerely temporall which will fitly serue both for the members of the Church &amp; of the Common-weale, to gouerne them both; as they did vnder the gouernement of the Iewish Common-weale. And therefore accordingly, the father, for the better and more effectuall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his whole Kingdome, hath furnished his sonne Christ, not onely with censures ecclesiasticall, but with an iron rodde; therewith to breake in peeces his enemies, like a potters vessell. And this rodde is either the multitude of temporall afflictions, comming from the immediate hand of Christ, vpon the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of the world; or those which are brought vpon the heads of the wicked, by the hands of the ciuill Kings; who bearing not the sword for nought, are the Ministers of God for to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his wrath vpon all them that doe euill. And therefore in the second of the Reuelation, the Lord Christ threatneth that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Iesabell,</hi> not with suspension, or with excommunication, that are the censures ecclesiasticall: but to cast her into a bedd; which is, to punish her sinnes with sickenesse, and other diseases of the body; and her sonnes he threatneth to kill with the sword. And in the third of the same booke, the same Lord, and King Iesus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth, that he chasteneth, and correcteth euery sonne whom he loueth. Chastisements therefore, and afflictions, whither ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall or ciuill, are the censures of the King Christ. And in the nineteenth of the same booke, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw a mighty army of men follow the word of God; who had a name written on his thygh, to be the King of the Kings, and Princes of the earth; and with this army attending him, their leader and King, he slewe a
<pb facs="tcp:27728:31"/> mightie army of his enemies; to eate vp whose flesh, an Angell that stood in the Sunne, called together al the beasts of the earth, and the birds of heauen. To gouerne therefore his Kingdome, the Lord Christ hath Angels, Deuils, armies of Kings &amp; Princes, fire, sword, famine, thunder, lightning, earthquakes, haile, stocks, whippes, prisons, bootes, rackes, gallowes, hurdels, axe, losse, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, banishment, sickenesse, shame, death, excommunication, suspension, and a number els: so many, and of so sundrie sorts, are the censures, and coertions of the Kingdome of Christ. And of all these, so many in number, in the greatest want of the Church, the Lord Christ put ouer vnto the rulers of the Church onely two principall the most vsuall whereof was excommunication, being a kind of banishment for a time from the Church of Christ; and being trusted onely with one or two at the most: how they face it out, as if all had beene put into their hands.</p>
               <p>Thus far then hitherto haue wee traced out steppe by steppe the truth of this point: and by testimonies apparant out of the holy Scriptures haue brought the matter to this issue, that the Lord Christ is King ouer all realmes and Churches: and that to gouerne them, he hath censures, not onely ecclesiasticall, but ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. But now the question is, whither the Lord doeth gouerne these his kingdomes here in earth, by his royal presence on earth; or by his Vicegerents, and substitutes: and by the answere of Christ to <hi>Pilate,</hi> this question receiueth a manifest and a plaine answere. For to <hi>Pilate</hi> Christ plainely telleth, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world: not meaning heereby to denie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest that he had in the Kingdomes and the Churches of this world: but his meaning is to tell <hi>Pilate,</hi> that his imperiall citie, which being the principall of his Kingdome, hee calleth meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically his Kingdome, his throne of glory, his kingly seate, his pallace royall, is not seated in this world: and that his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not to reigne in Ierusalem, as their king, nor at Rome as their Emperour, nor yet in any other of the Kingdomes of this world: but in heauen; where he shall not hinder the reigne of the kings of this earth. This king therfore sitteth and raigneth in heauen, and giueth place to the kings of the earth to reigne as kings vnder him. But then not gouerning these his kingdomes by his residence heere on earth: it must needes follow, that as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kings residing in their imperiall cities, doe gouerne those their kingdomes that are a farre off by Proconsuls, Deputies, or
<pb facs="tcp:27728:31"/> Vice-royes, which are their Vicars, and doe represent their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: so this King Christ doth visibly gouerne these Churches and Kingdomes of his, by his Vice-royes and earthly deputies. The further question then is, which of all the officers and rulers of the Common-weale and Church, are the Vice-royes and deputies of this King of heauen, to gouerne and to rule his whole realme on earth? What is the Pope the Vice-roy of Christ, for the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his whole Kingdome on earth? Indeede this power and great honour he doth arrogate vnto himselfe; but in no case can we yeelde him this. And as for our brethren, they had rather take it themselues, then giue it to him. What then are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters the Vice-royes, and next deputies vnder Christ, to gouerne this his Kingdome of the earth? Indeede they are his Vicars to teach his Church, and so Priests vnder the high Priest Christ. And they say, that they are the Vicars and Vice-royes of Christ immediate to gouerne his whole Kingdome, which as they say, is onely the Church: they are then belike, like vnto Christ▪ a King, and a Priest, such as was <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> a Prince, &amp; a Priest of the strong high God. But let all this be graunted vnto them, that they assume vnto themselues, yet dare they not intermedle with the earthly Kingdomes, nor ciuill censures of the King, which they falsly denie to be any parte of the Kingdome of Christ: and therefore they are not full Vice-royes indeede of the King of heauen▪ but we seeke a full Vice-roy of the king Christ, if he haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:27728:32"/> as <hi>Herod</hi> a King, being the subiect of the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, held his deputation, and Kingdome, of the Emperour of Rome, whose Vice-roy and substitute he was, for the gouerning of that parte of his Iewish Kingdome; wee therefore conclude, that as the Minister is the substitute of Christ, to teach the Church: so the King is the substitute, and Vicar of Christ, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church: and as it is the office of the Minister to teach the Church; so it is the office of the King to gouerne the Church: and as it is essentiall and ordinary to the Minister, to minister the word; so it is ordinary and essentiall to the King, to minister iustice, and to gouerne the whole Church of Christ. But so, as if the King doe, or shall neglect this parte of his duety; I meane the holy rule, and good gouernement of the Church of Christ: and in stead of well gouerning the Church, shall become a persecutor of the Church: then in the contempt and persecution of the King, extraordinarily, the Lord deputeth the Eldershippe, as his Vice-roy, to gouerne for him that part of his persecuted Church. And (ouer, and beside that which hath beene said) this may be well prooued out of other portions of the holy Writ: for, that it belongeth to the ordinary office of the king, to gouerne in his daies the Church of God, by his ciuil sword, appeareth plainely, by the example of all the godly kings of Iudah; who all, as their prerogatiue royall, euer had, and held this power and authority, by their ciuill sword onely, without the Ecclesiastical, to gouerne as the weale publique, so the whole Church of God, that was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. And againe that, in the persecution and contempt of the king, the Eldership might gouerne the Church of Christ, for Christ; appeareth by the example apparent of the Church Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue: which in the want of godly kings, receiued power from Christ, to gouerne for Christ, the Church of Christ. Godly kings therefore in their daies, as the chiefe Officers of the Church of Christ, are to gouerne the peaceable Church of Christ: but in the want of godly kings, the Eldershipp of the Church, is, in the persecution of the Church, to gouerne the persecuted Church of Christ. There are therefore two estates of the Church; the one peaceable, and the other persecuted: and according to these two estates, two kindes of Gouernours, and two kindes, as I may in some sort say, of Gouernements: to gouerne the peaceable Church, there is the ciuill king, and the ciuill sword; to gouerne the persecuted Church, there is the Eldershippe Ecclesiasticall,
<pb facs="tcp:27728:32"/> and there is the sword Ecclesiasticall; and neither of these must intermeddle in the time, or in the place of the other; but eyther of them must keepe his place and his time: in the dayes of peace, let the king raigne, and let the Eldershippe sleepe; in the daies of persecution the king sleepeth, let the Eldershippe then awake, and the sword Ecclesiasticall. For in the Primitiue times they had their seuerall times, and their seuerall places, to bestirre and occupy themselues in: when godly kings raigned in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church of the Iewes, the Eldership was not in vse. Againe in the Primitiue Church of Christ, when the Eldershippe raigned, the kings of the Gentiles, and the Iewes raged against the Church, they raigned not ouer the Church, as they ought: when kings slept, the Church gouernement awaked; againe when the kings awaked, the Church Gouernement slept. And thus in their Primitiue times, they were not both iumbled together, as our brethren would haue: but they had their seuerall standing, and vse apart one from the other; they had their interchaungeable raigne and their successiue vse and place; and so let them stand still: let them keepe their first place, and their fitte time, and their gouernements may both st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But the Discipline ciuill may haue his place in England, in Denmarke, and vnder al godly and christian kings. Distinguish times, saith one, and the Scriptures will agree: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the times and the places, &amp; the diuers gouernments wel agree: runne not on on a head, without the consideration of the times, and the places; and this controuersie shall haue an end.</p>
               <p>And thus you shall haue a wedge for this hard knotte: but if you will vnseasonably set them vp both at one time to raigne: and make them, being different, to be as one; and being of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers natures, to agree both in one gouernement, in one place, in one kingdome, you will attempt almost impossibilities, breede confusion, bring in disorder, make contentions, as betweene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries; and the one will iustle out the other, as by wofull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath beene found in the Gouernement of the Pope, and the Emperour: and therefore when the kings rage, then must the Church raigne: againe when kings raigne, then must the Church

               <p>ANd here the better to deduce this from the former grounds, we must beware, that wee doe not childishly imagine, that because the Kingdome of Christ reacheth vnto two sortes of estates, the Church, and the Common-weale: and because it hath beene executed by two kind of swords; therefore, that (as a fooles coate is made of two kinds of cloath, so) the one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, is made of two sorts of kingdomes; and that the one part of his kingdome is made, &amp; consisteth of one kind, and the other part of another kind: that the one part of his kingdome is an Ecclesiasticall kingdome; and that this was executed by Ecclesiasticall men, and by a sword Ecclesiasticall; and that the other part, is a ciuill kingdome; and that this was and is execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ciuill kings, and by a sword ciuill; and so that it was one Office of Christ, that was executed by the ministery gouerning the Church: and another office of Christ, that was executed by the king, gouerning the Church. No, it is plaine, that the power to gouerne the Church, that is giuen to the king, and to the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe, is the one and selfe s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:27728:33"/> Minister for the gouernement of the Church: but the very selfe same that was put ouer to the King before: and therefore the Church gouerned by the king, is gouerned by the same power whereby it was gouerned vnder the eldershippe: Secondly, that this power to gouerne the Church ordinarily, as his essentiall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, doth belong, and appertaine vnto the King; and the dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing King shall answere to God for his negligence herein; but he is not thereby depriued of the office. Thirdly, that being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the King, and essentiall to him: it could not be, but bee extraordinary, and onely accidentall vnto the Minister. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the power that the Minister had to exercise this office of the King, was extraordinarily made lawfull by the power of Christ: who onely (necessity so requiring) might l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whence I inferre, that seeing it is ordinary, and essential to the King to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church, and extraordinary to the Minister, and but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidentall: that the king executing his gouernement, the Church must n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The king did not execute his office, &amp; the Church found leaue, fauour and power from Christ, to execute his office for him: and therefore this power of the Church to gouerne for the king, in reason could no longer continue, then till the king would gouerne himselfe, and with his owne sword ciuill, as with his owne handes execute his owne office. For what reason, or what need, had the Church, by her sword Ecclesiasticall to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church for the king: when he was willing and able of himselfe to gouerne it by his owne sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In the dayes of persecution, there being then no feare, least the Minister should lift vp himselfe in the greatnesse of his person ouer kings, might such an office, with more reason be put vpon him: Especially need so requiring. But now no need so requiring, for a minister to beare an office vnder a Christian king (that denieth the Minister no part of his honour) greater then the office of the king; is a way to lift him vp aboue the king, and so to make him Antichrist: and therefore in the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the hindering of Antichrist, is truely ascribed to the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Emperour, that withheld the reuelation, that is the setting
<pb facs="tcp:27728:35"/> of him vp. For he euer kept this person, that would be counted so great a person, vnder: but when he was taken away, then the Ministers being (as they held) so great persons, and honoured by kings Christian, according to their pretended greatnesse, lifted vp themselues aboue kings; and thus sprung Antichrist vp: so that if our brethrens doctrine bee true, then they must let fall their claime to the Church Gouernement, vnder a Christian king, or else be greater then the king. But if our doctrine be true, &amp; theirs be false; then must they needs let the claime fall too, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons aboue-said: and now let them chuse, which they will doe. For which soeuer be true, I will still hold, &amp; conclude, that vnder a Christian king, the Church lost his Primitiue Gouernment Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, and that the raigne of the Eldership is determined in the raigne of godly kings Christian: this the Pope not knowing, holdeth still his power like <hi>Saul,</hi> that hauing seased on the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, would not part frō it, to his neighbor <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; so is become Antichrist; this the Popish kings not knowing, doe slauishly leaue this power in the Popes hands: and this our brethren not knowing, forgoe their Ministery, because they may not obtaine this their desired, and now long thirsted after kingdome.</p>
               <p>But my labour, and desire is, that all men may see with me this truth, and take knowledge, that there is something in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that is essentiall: which they receiued both then, and now, from the Church, by vertue of their Ecclesiasticall function: and that is the ministration of the word, and Sacraments: and there was something which was accidentall, and altogether mutable, and that was a branch of the regall, and ruling power: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, when the ordinary ruling power came into the Church, that was wanting before. And hauing lost this power, they cannot hold it now, but at the pleasure of the king: who if he will, may giue it ouer vnto others: or returne againe vnto the Church, the power ouer all, sauing ouer himselfe. For I hold, that the king is not to loose his place, nor to suffer himselfe to be top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by any subiect, in his kingdome. And sith some must bee free from all rule vnder heauen, in some things: as the Pope would be; it is most fit, that the king should be exempt from all vnder rule, and left vnto the immediate power and rule of God. As the Apostle left the vnbeleeuers, that were without, in some things, neither to the rule of the heathen kings, that would not, nor to the Church that should not iudge them: but onely vnto
<pb facs="tcp:27728:35"/> the iudgement of God, saying, doe not yee iudge them that are within? them that are without God shall iudge: and here obserue their contrariety, that hold a necessity of their discipline in all the Church, and yet except from discipline the head of the Church; which is the king, and if they except the head, I will except the body; for the same is the reason of the whole and the part.</p>

               <head>REASON XVII.</head>
               <p>BVt our aduersaries haue subscribed, not onely vnto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but vnto the supremacie also of the king: with the which I plainely see that Ecclesiasticall Discipline cannot stand. Without Ecclesiasticall Discipline, the king is supreme Gouernour of all persons, as well Ecclesiasticall, as Ciuill: but with Ecclesiasticall Discipline, the king is vnder the rule of the pastors, and Elders of the Church. For in Ecclesiasticall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, the whole congregation of euery particular Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of the rulers thereof, and of the people that are vnder their rule. The rulers are, either the Bishops, or the Elders of the Church: all the rest, whither they be iudges, or rulers of the land, Whither they be Lords, or Councellours, whither they be Kings, or Queenes, are to be ruled; and so by consequent, to be vnder the rule of the Pastors, and Elders of the Church. Now the king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Elder, for that is to be lesse then the Pastor; nor no Pastor, for that sorteth not with his calling: must needes bee vnder the rule of his particular Pastor, or Bishop; if he be vnder, he cannot be aboue him, then not his supreme head. Then being vnder his rule, here must needs at the least arise a controuersie (as betweene the Bishop of Rome, and the Emperour) whither of these two should be the chiefe, and vnto whom the supremacie should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. The Emperour he challenging it, because the Bishop was his subiect; the Bishop challenging it, because the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a member, &amp; a child of his Church, was vnder the rule of him, the head and father of all his particular Church. Now to ende this controuersie, the Emperour he draweth his Ciuill sword: and the Pope draweth his Ecclesiasticall sword; and there begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it the Pope he rebelleth against his king, and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him. And say, that it breake not forth into open warres: yet the seede, and sparke of this fire lying hidde within cannot but kindle inward grudge, in the king: because his subiects would
<pb facs="tcp:27728:36"/> rule him: and in his subiects; I meane, his Pastors, and Elders: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee will not bee ruled by them. Therefore the king must needs keepe vnder, or curbe Ecclesiasticall Discipline, or else bee kept vnder, and curbed by Ecclesiasticall Discipline. And either loosing his supremacie ouer the Pastors, &amp; Elders of his Church, put himselfe vnder them, and vnder their authoritie; or else put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them downe, set vp himselfe, and his rule ouer the Pastors, and Elders of the Church.</p>
               <p>I haue a heard a Papist say, that the Ecclesiasticall Discipline could not stand with an absolute Monarchy. For that it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the supremacie from the king: and shareth halfe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (which is the absolute rule of all the Church, which is not halfe, but all the kingdome) with the king: and againe, I haue heard some of our aduersaries say, that Popery could not stand with a Monarchy: for that it taketh away the supremacie from the king, and vsurpeth authority ouer the whole Church in his kingdome, which is the whole kingdome of the land. The Pope, as Christ his Vicar, challengeth an immediate power from Christ, ouer all, yea ouer kings, and princes: and so our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries challenge ouer all, yea ouer kings and Princes, a power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate from Christ, to gouerne them all in the Church, as the Vicegerents, and rulers of Christ, yea as the Vicars of Christ: and then if they haue rule ouer the king, in like manner must they haue rule ouer all the subiects of the king: &amp; indeed in a Church, confounded as ours is with the Common-weale, if the Pastors rule ouer all the Church, then they rule ouer all the kingdome: and yet farther, if excommunication may bee vsed in all criminall causes, as our aduersaries hold: then haue they power to rule ouer all the kingdome, in all causes, as well Ecclesiasticall as Ciuill. And thus of them both, is brought forth this monster in nature: that the king should bee ouer all, and yet vnder his subiects: that the king should gouerne in all causes, Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill: and yet the Church gouerne in all causes, as well Ecclesiasticall, as Ciuill. And I wonder that a Papist can see this monster in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, and not in the Pope. And againe, that our aduersaries can see this in popery, and not in their Discipline Ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>And thus I heare either, to accuse each other, and if either of both say true, then neither of both is sound, and a friend to the Kings suprem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:27728:36"/> more by force of reason: then by any experience of disloyaltie. And although they cannot hold their discipline, with the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie: yet before, they thought, in the error of their iudgement, that well they might vphold both. Onely this in our brethren is to be misliked: that hating Popery: in this point they should be rancke Papists, though ignorantly. And that praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and laboring to discouer Antichrist: themselues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ould ioyne with, and vphold Antichrist: yea in that wherein he is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist? For if this ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth the Pope Antichrist: for that he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp himselfe in his rule aboue all that is worshipped, or called God: and they ioyne with them in this, and say, that the Church, that is the Bishoppes of the Church haue this power indeede, ouer Kings and Princes: and so vphold them in that: doe they not vphold the Pope, in that very thing, that maketh him very Anitchrist? And thus I see, how zeale without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a desire to set vp the Church discipline ouer king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and Kings, set vp vnawares Antichrist himselfe: and mounted the man of pride to that great and wonderfull height. And euen then, when in Rome was set vp the authoritie of the Bishoppe, or chiefe Pastor of Rome, ouer the Emperor: then was set vp Antichrist in Rome.</p>
               <p>And here if any man aske of me? why it being the will of God that the rule of the Church should then cease, when Emperors became Christians, that it was not plainely so mentioned, and expresly reuealed in the Scriptures? my answere is: that the Lord would leaue a way by hiding this for a time, (which hee would open in his time) for to let in, and to set vp Antichrist: whom he would reueale in his time: euen as in hiding the end of the law of <hi>Moyses,</hi> he laid a snare, to take therein the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Iewes, whom of old hee purposed to cast of. And heere brethren consider, what a grosse error it is, to hold a discipline against the supremacy of the King: which is in your owne iudgement, to hold treason: and to hold an opinion against the proportion of faith. And how little it becometh Christian men, to vphold the raigne of the Popes, and the Bishop of Rome, ouer the Emperour and ouer the Kings of the earth. And therfore for my part hauing subscribed to the Supremacy, I make no bones of it, to subscribe to the present Gouernement establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by our godly, and Christian King.</p>

                     <p>It they deny that they haue power and right in the immediate authoritie of Christ to rule ouer the Church of England, which containeth and includeth all the subiects of the king, they yeeld me the question, and denie their Primitie Gouernment, and the Church Discipline. For the Primitiue Gouernment, or Church Discipline, as they hold it, is nothing but a certaine power, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by Iesus Christ, giuen to the Elders of the Church to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church, by the censures of the Church: now he that denieth this right, denieth his Primitiue Discipline.</p>
                     <p>If they auouch that such authority and right they haue: they take halfe the kingdome frō the king: they equall &amp; shole them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the kin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I conclude the fore that the Church must loose her kingdome, or the king his kingdome; the one halfe of it at the least now whither hath most reason to yeeld vp his kingdome, iudge you?

<pb facs="tcp:27728:40"/> cannot stand. For in the Iewish kingdome, all sinnes being iustly punished, according to the iudiciall law of <hi>Moyses,</hi> by the ciuill Magistrate, there were no sinnes left to be punished by the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall censures: there was then no vse, nor place at all, in such a kingdome as that, left for the Discipline of the Primitiue Church. Now then if the kingdome of Iewrie, and the Church affixed thereunto, might be gouerned by another policie of God, then the Primitiue Church pollicie was, and yet bee allowed, nay planted of God, and flourish without Ecclesiasticall Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: may not trow you, the kingdome of England, and the Church affixed there vnto, be gouerned by some other pollicie then the Ecclesiasticall pollicie, and yet be gouerned by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pollicie of God: planted by God himselfe: and flourish pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing well, without Ecclesiasticall Gouernment? If with the kingdome and Church of the Iewes, gouerned by the pollicie of God, this their Ecclesiasticall pollicie of God, could not possibly stand: then the like kingdome being here, as there was; with our pollicie of God, could not bee placed, nor stand their pollicie of God. And thus the pollicie of God, should not stand with the pollicie of God: the Ecclesiasticall pollicie of God, with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill pollicie of God. And therefore they were neuer made both by God to stand both together: but the one, that I meane of the Primitiue Church, to haue his place in a single Church, where the kings were wanting: the other, I meane that pollicy of the Iewish kingdome, to haue his place in a Church compounded, as ours is, with a Common-weale, where-ouer one Christian king beareth the whole sway. And thus God in mercy hath giuen a pollicie in his word, for a Church persecuted: which is to haue his place in a Church persecuted: and a policie for a Church peaceable, vnder a Christian king: that is to haue place in such a kingdome. And I wonder that our aduersaries see not this distinction: and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not how God hath giuen a seuerall kind of Gouernment, to these seuerall and diuerse kinds of Churches, and what reason they haue to thrust vpon a Church peaceable, that kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, that God gaue to a persecuted Church, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the order of God, and nature of things, to giue the forme of one thing, to a diuerse, and almost contrary thing: the forme of a persecuted Church, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:27728:40"/>
               <p>I demaund whether, a Christian king may not punish all sinnes whatsoeuer, by the Ciuill Magistrate: as the kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> did, by the law of God? And I doubt not, but that they will easily yeeld vnto me this. If then the king may punish all sinnes by the Ciuill Magistrate: then are there none left to be punished by the Discipline of the Church. If there be no sinnes to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by it, then is there no vse of it; nor nothing at all for it to do there: if it hath there nothing to doe, and if there be no vse of it; then is it vtterly laid on the ground, ouerthrowen, and made void, and vaine in such a Common-weale. And therefore in some Common-weales there is made a meere nullitie of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Discipline; but our Common-weale is such, or may be easily made such: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in our Common-weale there is, or may be a meere nullitie of Ecclesiasticall Discipline.

And then, if our Gouernment be, or may be, in that number, and of that sort, and kind: then is it not of necessitie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon our Church, and kingdome; All sinnes may be heere punished by the Ciuill Magistrate: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there neede to bee none left to the Ecclesiasticall censures: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there may bee no vse of them, in this Church, and kingdome of ours: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they may bee vtterly taken away, or suffered to sleepe, in this kingdome of ours. And heere I charge our aduersaries, before the liuing God, that shall iudge all flesh, that if euer they meane to reply, besides the rest, that they remember to shape me a sound answere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauelling, to this argument of mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if it be a sinne for the Church, with the censures therof, not to ioyne in punishing sinne, with the Ciuill Magistrate: Oh Lord how long haue euen our aduersaries themselues liued in this sin? that haue all this while (being fully perswaded that this had bene their dutie) and that against the light of their consciences, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this their bounden dutie.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:27728:41"/>
               <p>And heere I would know how or when kings Christian lost this power to rule the whole Church and Common-weale, by the sword Ciuill, without the Ecclesiasticall: who, as all godly kings set vp and approued by God, euer had power and authoritie so to doe.</p>
               <p>Yea the whole Primitiue Church sinned in this point, and that by commandement from <hi>Paul:</hi> who forbidding them to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them that were without, did not suffer the Church, to ioyne with the Common weale, in punishing of sinne.</p>
               <p>Yea the <hi>Sannedrim,</hi> Iesus Christ our Lord, and the Apostles of our Sauiour Christ, sinned, in that they ioyned not with <hi>Herod,</hi> with <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the rest of the Romane gouernors in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of sinne: but we feare not to sinne with the Churches of all ages, for so many hundred yeeres together: with the blessed Apostles and with our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ himselfe.</p>

For the church doth but represent it, but death doth present it; the Church doth but foreshew it, but death doth really shew it: the Church doth but put in the feare, but death putteth in the feeling of it; the Church doth but giue the sentence, but death gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the present sence of it: and is the very executioner of excommunication.

               <p>And surely, had this combination beene a matter of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and of that necessitie, I assure my selfe, that the Lord would not haue denied both, to his owne, and peculiar people the Iewes. Nor to his owne, which was the first, and the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, but in that he giueth to them both, but either of them both: he plainely lets vs see, what the iudgement of God is in this case: and that is, that either of them both, is of power, and all-sufficient, to worke repentance, in all that belong, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the calling of God: and then if one, without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be sufficient to worke repentance: In vaine is it to vse more meanes to worke that, which by fewer meanes may be wrought as effectually.</p>
               <p>And as for the preseruation of the sound, from the infection of the wicked, there can be no better meanes to effect that: then to make an vtter seperation betweene them, and of seperations, there can bee none either more full, or more finall, then that, which is made by death: by the which the corrupter of men, is vtterly taken from among men: and seperated finally from the sonnes of men. And being cut off from the earth, can neuer hurt the men of the earth any more. Now this seperation being made by the Ciuill Magistrate, is farre more full, then the seperation, that is made by excommunication: and therefore to effect this by the addition of excommunication, to the Ciuill sword, is more then palpable folly.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that if for the reuenge of sinne: or for the breeding of repentance: or for the preseruation of the good: there be no necessary coupling together, of the Ciuill, and of the Ecclesiasticall censures required: then is there no necessary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that may, or can inforce, the necessary coniunction of these two at all. But wee haue shewed before, that for none of these causes is required, any necessary coniunction of those two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: and therefore, it followeth, that of those two, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no necessary coniunction at all.</p>

               <p>ANd yet further, if of necessitie the Church, and the Ciuill power, must be ioyned together in all things: then they must ioyntly proceede, not onely to punish sinne: but also, to iudge betweene brother and brother, in matters of controuersie, and in cases of right and law. And indeede, the Apostle, that in the fift to the Corinthians, and the latter end therof; inuested the Church in the right, and power to punish sinne by excommunication: in the very next words, which is in the beginning of the sixt, giueth power, and authoritie to the Church, to iudge betweene brother and brother, in matters of law; so that the Church, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Apostle, hath as good right, to iudge in matters of law: as it hath, to iudge in matter of sinne. If then, they must ioyne with the Ciuill Iudge in cases of right: then must wee pull downe our seates of iudgement, and build gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ater: that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, not onely the Iudges of the Law, the Iustices of Peace, and their Officers: but also, the Ministers, and Elders of the whole Shire: then must the Ministers turne their studies, to looke out what is right, and law in matters of controuersies: then must they cease, to waite onely vpon the Ministerie of the word: and intermeddle with all cases, and controuersies of the whole land▪ then must they deale in all those cases, wherein the iudges, and Iustices of peace, are tied by their office to deale; a thing which they permit not, no not to the Bishops of the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch. And little reason shall they haue to condemne the Pope, for vsurping au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in Ciuill cases; when they themselues hold it still to bee the right of the Church: &amp; themselues intermeddle therein. But if vnder a Christian King, and vnder Christian Iudges, they hold this to be no necessary duety of the Church; how doe they hold it, vnder a Christian king, and vnder Christian Iudges, a matter of necessitie, for the Church, with the ciuill Iudge, to punish sinne? And if they can see, that the power to iudge in matter of right, was but extraordinary, and onely for the times of persecution, and for want of Christian Magistrates: how commeth it to passe that they cannot see that the power to punish sinne, was only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie, and for the dayes of persecution, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r the want of Christian Magistrates? For they haue no more power to doe the one, then they haue to doe the other; and the power to doe the one, they must hold to haue ceased: or else they must hold
<pb facs="tcp:27728:45"/> the absurdities afore mentioned: now let them choose of these two, which they will hold.</p>
               <p>And here I might stand to bring forth those particular cases, wherein the Church ought not to ioyne with the Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, in punishing of sin; as in the cases of death, of present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and such like: and here I might shew the great questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might arise about their manner of proceeding: the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test places, and the fittest times; the great also inconueniences, the manifold absurdities, and the meere impossibilities, implied herein, all which I omit: hauing dwelt already ynough, if not too long, in this point. And thus I haue plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly prooued, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t it is no sinne to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sioyne, nor no matter of necessity to conioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both these aforenamed censures.</p>
               <p>But though they cannot hold it to bee a matter of necessitie, yet perchaunce they will hold it to bee a matter of expediencie, and that it were meete for the better Gouernment of the Church, to be set vp in this, and all other kingdomes of the world. But whither it be meete, or not meete, I will be no iudge in this case: but leaue the t iall of that, to men of more wisedome, and of better iudgement then my se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe am. For if they hold it a matter of no necessitie, but onely of indifferencie; and that where it is found expedient, it may be vsed: where it is found a matter of inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, there it may be refused; they giue me my question, and hold with me, that vnder a Christian king, it is a matter meerely indifferent: and that there is no necessity laid vpon the king, to entertaine it, or to set it vp, in this land and kingdome of his.</p>
               <p>If therefore they hold it but a matter of expediency: they giue me my question.</p>
               <p>If th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y hold it a matter of necessitie, I shewed them their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and therefore vpon the praemises I conclude, that the king by the Ciuill sword onely, may punish all sinnes, without the Ecclesiasticall: and so leaue no vse no place; nor nothing for Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Discipline to doe, in this Realme, and kingdome of his. And thus my argument remaineth firme, demonstratiue, and is not, by any possible meanes, to be answered.</p>
               <p>And thus they graunting, that the Gouernment of the Iewish kingdome, and Church; is not to vs necessary: and wee hauing proued, that the Gouernment of the Primitiue Church, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a matter of necessitie to vs: it followeth, that it is free for
<pb facs="tcp:27728:46"/> the king to set vp either of them both, or to ioine together either of them both, or to receiue neither of them both: and therefore, that it is lawfull for the king to set vp some other (if it may be) more fit, for Godlines, and peace, then either of them both bee. And then, if it be lawfull for the king, without sinne to set it vp; it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t we in subscribing to this godly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gouernment of the King▪ haue committed no sinne, neither are we guiltie of Apostacy, or of treason to God, to his Church, or to his holy truth. But of sound knowledge, and of faith, &amp; of infallible grounds out of the holy word of God, in peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and in the peace of the Church, haue lawfully subscribed to the holy Gouernment of the Land, and Church.</p>
               <p>And thus, wee haue spoken in regard of the apparent trueth of the cause, something too much; in regard of our enemies and friendes, fully ynough: but in regard of our selues, something too little. For we desire at full, to let the world see, with what feare of God, with what care of our consciences, and vpon what sound grounds, wee haue proceeded. How diligently wee haue searched out the trueth, &amp; how we haue looked into euery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooke and corner of the cause.</p>
               <p>And therefore in a word, wee will handle one point farther: for the satisfying of our enemies, and for the clearing of our selues: and that is, that this Gouernement of ours, onely in a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie circumstance, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d in no materiall point, differeth from the Primitiue Gouernement of the Church. And this necessary circumstance, is in the onely addition of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the power of the King, to the auncient officers, and the power of the Church. And that to this end; that the king, as his duetie, and place requireth, may see, that the censures of the Church be iustly, without all partiality, put in execution.</p>
               <p>And heere to shew you this, I must tell you first: that in this our Church, wee haue in vse all the censures of the Primitiue Church. For wee haue in vse admonitions: lawfull for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the Elders of the Church: we haue suspension from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in vse, and lawfull for the minister alone; and we haue in vse excommunication, lawfull for the minister to administer: but so as the approbation, and coniunction of the king, and the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the king, for the faithfuller, and more forcible proceeding be first had, and obtained: and these are all the censures, that euer
<pb facs="tcp:27728:46"/> were in vse in the Primitiue Church.</p>
               <p>And as we haue all the ruling censures in vse, that euer the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church had; so haue we all the same officers, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church had, for the putting in execution of the Primitiue censures. For the officers of the Primitiue Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch, that onely, or principally intermedled in the administration of the Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, were either lay, or else ministeriall Elders: the ministeriall Elders were either the Pastors of the Church; or els the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Euangelists of Christ, to whom it was giuen to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, and ouer-rule the whole Church: as for the lay Elders, they haue their being, &amp; standing place in this Church of ours, vnder the name &amp; title of Churchwardens, and Sidemen, to whom it is made lawfull to ouer-see the maners of the whole Church, to giue to the offensiue parties, holy and wholesome admonitions, &amp; of the greater offences, to informe themselues, their particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, &amp; together with their Pastor, to informe the officers of the King; &amp; so iointly to proceede to the execution of punishment, vpon the offensiue perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: the Elders therfore of our Church are the first, that espie &amp; detect the fault, that giue countenance, and consent, to the punishing of the fault, &amp; desire vnder their hands, the help of the king, for the punishing of the fault, and this is, as I can soundly gather, all that the Elders had to doe in the Primitiue Church.</p>
               <p>And if any be iniured, or haue cause to complaine, it is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Minister; but let vs see what iust cause of complaint is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to the Ministers. First, as watchmen, they haue power to spie out the sinnes of the whole flocke: they haue power to admonish, to reproue, to exhort, and to rebuke them that sinne openly. Secondly, they haue authority to suspend, and for a time to seperate from the supper of the Lord, the offensiue man: onely the absolute and free power to put in execution excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (the weightest censure of the Church) for the causes afore mentioned, is restrained, till the king be fully informed; of the needfull, and the iust vse thereof.

<pb facs="tcp:27728:47"/> in the name of God, and the king. So the minister, is the first, that with the Elders, seeth the fault; the king is but the second, that searcheth out, and looketh into the accused sinne: the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, with the Elders, are the first that detect the sinne: the king is but the second, that examineth the detected sinne; the Elders, with the ministers, are the first, that thinke the sin to be worthy of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, that giue their allowance, &amp; countenance therunto: the king is but the second that well waigheth, first the cause, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth, whither it deserue excommunication; the minister, first consenteth, and in his priuate iudgement, excommunicateth the person; craueth and desireth the authority, and consent of the king: the king is the second in all this, and consenteth not, but vpon reasonable and iust cause: and so maketh a wise stay of all rash and partiall proceeding, and layeth a bridle vpon all sinister affections of the ministery. But the king vpon sound delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and weighing well the matter, consenteth to the minister; and as he is first in power so onely in this one thing is he the first, that pronounceth the sentence; and the minister onely in this is but the second: and thus, where the cause is iust, there ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the king and the minister, in throwing out of the Church, a wicked man; the king first pronounceth him, then the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster denounceth him, to be an excommunicate person: and thus the minister hath his share, and interest in excommunication, as had the Pastors of the Primitiue Church: but restrained, as needs must be; that the authoritie of the king, may come in betweene, and haue his iust place in the Gouernment of Gods Church, and though by this meanes, there be made some stay; yet the stay is recompenced, with the sound, and more adui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And here what other cause haue our ministers to complaine, as if they were wronged; saue onely that they are ouer-looked, and ruled by the king, and be not as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute monarches in their Church, as the Pope is in his, or the king is in his? and now let our aduersaries speake, if such a one be an intollerable circumstance: and whither a man, by reason of this, is iustly, and with a good conscience, withheld from subscription to the present estate.</p>
               <p>And thus, because the Church is increased with the person, and
<pb facs="tcp:27728:47"/> the power of the king: therefore the Church, beside the aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent officers thereof, hath receiued the increase of the officers, of the king; and these are the seuerall Bishops, of euery seuerall dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: which our aduersaries hold, to be an ouerplus, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary burden to the Church. But I hold them, in, and ouer the Church, as necessary, as is the officers, and power of the king. For they bare the office, the rule, and the person of the king, in, and ouer, the whole Church. And therefore more plainely, to lay out this, to the vnderstanding of the simple: they must know, that in the person of the king, (who is, as our lawes hold him, a person mixed, of a lay, and a spirituall man) is inuested, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of spirituall, and of lay men: the Gouernment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the land, and the Gouernement of the whole Church of the land. Now the hands of the king, being by nature too short, to reach forth his Gouernement from one end of so great a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to the other: are by Arte Politique, made exceeding long: by ioyning thereunto, the armes of inferior men: all which faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, lengthen out the armes of the king, and make him able for the smiting of a sinner, to reach, from one side of the kingdome, to the other: and from one end of the Church, to the furthermost part thereof. The king therefore, being not able to ouersee his subiects, without his subiects: for the better ruling of his subiect Church, and land: (according to the councell of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro,</hi> to <hi>Moyses</hi>) communicateth, and imparteth, to some suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, among his subiects, a little beame of that his imperiall rule, and Gouernment, ouer the whole Church. And the persons to whom the king hath giuen of his spirit, that is, of his power to gouerne the Church, the men, the affaires, and the censures of the Church, are the Lords spirituall: that is the Reuerend Bishops of the land, whom the king hath increased, &amp; made great by giuing vnto them so great a power, by imposing vpon thē so great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as his owne is; &amp; answerably thereunto, by indowing them, with Barronies, and with the wealth and titles of great, and mighty Lords. Now these by the authority, and power of the king, being set ouer a whole Diocesse; that consisteth perchance, of many hundred parishes: are not possibly able, with their own eyes, to view and ouersee the manners, and seuerall sinnes, of so many hundred Ministers, and of so great a multitude of men: nor yet in all those places, the right execution of the Primitiue Church Gouernment, without the helpe of their inferiour men:
<pb facs="tcp:27728:48"/> they therfore are inforced againe, to set vnder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And thus it appeareth, that an addition of some such officers, must of necessitie, vnder a Christian king be had, to ouersee the right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Primitiue Church Gouernment: or else, the Church of England must be exempted, and set free, from the supreame authoritie of the king: as the Church of Rome, and the Pope is; but our aduersaries by their subscription approue not this. And although the laying of this bridle vpon the ministers, layeth open a gappe, to many inferior Officers, of much bribery, and partiall dealing: yet for any thing I see, it openeth thereunto, no greater gappe, no, nor in reason, so great as it would; if the bridle were taken away, and the Ministers left, to Lord it ouer their seuerall flockes. And therefore, if the king; then the officers of the king, be necessarily added to the Church of God: and if the king be not, how shall wee count the officers of the king, a burden, to the Church? but the spirit of Antichrist would be free, and bee set aloft, would rule, and ouerlooke all, but would be ruled, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked of none.</p>
               <p>But heere ariseth a question, where about our aduersaries wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle exceeding much, &amp; that is: whither the king may not take of the ministers of the Church, as wel as of lay men, &amp; set them in his place, to rule ouer the Church; to ouersee the particular procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of euery Church, and indue these ministers, representing his person, with the honour, the titles, and liuings of Lords. And howsoeuer it is vnsauery in the sense of our aduersaries: yet to me it seemeth a thing exceeding harde, that the ministrie of Iesus Christ, and the publike seruice of God, should keepe him from all worldly preferment, and for euer after, (as if he had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of some notable crime) make him vncapable of all Ciuill honour.</p>
               <p>But heere to prooue the Ministers vtterly vncapable of all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honour, they alleage the saying of Christ to his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sciples, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb facs="tcp:27728:48"/> for the supremacie. Mat. 20.26. You know (saith Christ) that the Princes of the people bare rule ouer them; and they that are great men exercise authoritie ouer thē: &amp; (as <hi>Luke</hi> sayth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.29) are called gratious Lords: but it shal not be so among you. From hence they inferre, that by Christ it is forbidden to the Ministers of the Church, to beare the titles, or the office of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lords: and verely so well might they seeme to doe, if these were words of commandement, and spoken indifferently to all the ministers of Christ.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I hold, (first) these words to concerne the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ministers of Christ nothing at all: but to be spoken onely to his Disciples, as many other things were. For these words were spoken onely to them, the people being absent; and that not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any doctrine before deliuered: but by occasion of a priuate controuersie betweene themselues moued, and that was, which of all thē twelue, Christ being a temporall king, (for so they often before, and euen then dreamed) should carry the greatest sway, and be the most gratious, and honorable Lord; matters, out of all controuersie, onely concerning themselues, and their priuate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: and touching the after Church of Christ, nothing at all; to this Christ maketh that answere before mentioned: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in telleth them, that vnder him, and in his kingdome, which was not of this world, they must neuer hope for, nor expect, those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable titles nor that lordly nor earthly rule: that in the courts of earthly kings, and princes of this world, such honourable titles might be had, but in his kingdome it was not so. And therefore their honour should not consist in the possession of offices, and titles that were of that nature: but rather in the painefull worke of their Ministery, in the which, whosoeuer was the most painfull man, should be the most honourable man. So that if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie was onely concerning themselues, and touched the Church of God no farther, then onely in the knowledge hereof, as out of all doubt it was; and if the answere of Christ was direct to their question, as out of all controuersie it was: then it must needes be spoken to the Disciples of Christ onely, as many other things were: and therefore not to touch, nor to bind the after mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ any thing at all: no more, then they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to preach the Gospell to all nations of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Disciples of Christ were commaunded so. And yet this better appeareth, by the answere it selfe, that Christ maketh to

There are diuersitie of gifts in the Church: an Euangelist, is more then an ordinarie Minister of the Church; a Prophet is more then an Euangelist: and an Apostle, is more then a Prophet, and more then euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister else of the Church.

               <p>And yet further, if these words of Christ forbid the office, and title of a gratious Lord, to the ministers of Christ: then they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid also to them, the exercise of authority ouer others. For he that saith, they are called gratious Lords: saith also, they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise authoritie ouer others: and by that commaundement, that sayth, it shall not be so with you, forbiddeth both alike. If so, then as the Ministers must not be called gratious Lords: so they must not exercise authoritie ouer others.

<pb facs="tcp:27728:50"/> of some of you to this is, that Christ forbiddeth onely the exercising of Lordly, or tyrannicall authoritie ouer others: and not the exercise of lawfull Ecclesiasticall authority; and is not this I pray you the very answere of the Bishops to these words, and for the other part of the sentence also? and doe you not see, that you are driuen to the very same interpretation, for the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of your Discipline, that they are for the vpholding of their Lordships? and yet is the answere good, as it commeth from, and serueth for you? and is it naught, as it commeth from, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for them? brethren, this is no good dealing.</p>
               <p>But others answere, that Christ forbidding the exercising of authority, forbiddeth them only the exercising of ciuill authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And these men you see plainely answere, by making a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction: and shewing, that there are two sortes of authoritie; the ciuill, and the spirituall: and that Christ forbiddeth onely to his Disciples the one, and not the other; very well, heere you take libertie to answere by a distinction. And if you may take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to doe this in one part of the sentence: may not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops take libertie to answere the other part of the same sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, by the same distinction? and say likewise, that as there is a ciuill and a spirituall authoritie: so there are ciuill, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Lords to exercise those authorities: and that the Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth them onely to be Lords Temporall: but not to be Lords spirituall; and so by this your owne answere, you must receiue an answere to your owne obiections.</p>
               <p>And so by this answere of yours, if it be right, the meaning of Christ must be to forbid his Disciples, of poore fishermen, &amp; Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples persecuted, to become great, and honourable Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: and to intermeddle with the greatest offices and sway of the Iewish Common-weale. A thing in my iudgement, so farre from the meaning of Christ, that I may say of this, that <hi>recitasse,</hi> is <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>futasse:</hi> to repeate it, is vtterly ynough to refute it. For who seeth not, that Christ vseth, as others, to forbid such things, as men are likely to fall into? but there was no likelihood that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Disciples of Christ should become Temporall gratious Lordes: that is Dukes, or Peeres of the land, and carry the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Iewish Realme: no the Lord often foretelleth them this will neuer bee: it is therefore ridiculous to thinke that the meaning of Christ was to forbid this: but it is not so to thinke that he did foretell this.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27728:50"/>
               <p>So that if for the vpholding of your authority, you expound those words, as spoken of tyrannicall authoritie, you lumpe with the Bishops, if as spoken of ciuill authoritie: you make your selues an answere: and what farther answere shall you neede?</p>
               <p>And yet farther, let it be graunted, that Christ forbiddeth to his Disciples the rule and the titles of Ciuill Lords: because hee would not haue his Church erected by countenance, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie Ciuill: least the worke should seeme to come of man, and not of God: Yet how doth it follow, that in a Church erected by pouertie, there can bee no place for riches, and Ciuill authoritie? and sith Christ forbadde it to the twelue: how doth it follow, that therefore hee forbad it to all the after Ministers of Iesus Christ? as if the Lord did enuie all riches, and worldly honour to those, that he hath made heires with Christ, of this world, and the world to come.</p>
               <p>And yet further, say that a Minister, as he is a Minister of Christ, may not inioy the title of a Lord: yet how is he heere forbidden, as he is the minister of the king, and beareth his person, to receiue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame, if by the king it be put vpon him? I conclude therfore, that this place of Christ proueth it not to be vnlawfull for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ, to receiue the wealth &amp; titles, of gratious Lords.</p>
               <p>The second place that is brought by our aduersaries against the Lordship of Bishops, is taken out of the first Epistle of <hi>Peter,</hi> 5.3. where the Apostle exhorteth the Elders of the Church, to feed the flock which dependeth on them: and to take care of it, not by compulsion, but willingly; not as lording it ouer the lords heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but as ensamples of the flocke: all which, it is plaine, that the Apostle giueth not as a law, to forbid ciuill lordships to a Bishop: but imperious, and stately rule, to a minister. For the Apostle forbiddeth that sin that was incident, not only to aftertimes: but that which was incident to the times that were present then. But though the sinne (as they call it) of ciuill lordship, be incident to our dayes: yet was it not incident to those troubled, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted daies, of the Primitiue Church. Secondly, the Apostle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this precept to the particular ministers of euery seuerall, and lesser flocke, and not to the ouerseers of the Church: such as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie. Titus,</hi> and our Bishoppes are: and therefore it is falsly wrested against them. Thirdly, it is giuen to the lawfull Elders of the Church: and then if our Bishops bee not, as our aduersaries hold it, the lawfull elders of the Church, this precept concerneth
<pb facs="tcp:27728:51"/> them nothing at all: and though the lesser and inferior ministers, may not be Lords: yet how doth it follow, that the ouerseers &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Church, may not be Lords? fourthly, the Apostle doth not forbid lordship in, or to the Church: but lordly raigning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Church: a Bishop may be a Lord, and yet not Lord it, nor Lord-like raigne ouer the Church: but in all vprightnesse, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and high lowlinesse, rule ouer it. A Barony, is a priuate honor to the Bishop: and not a publique power or lordship, ouer the Church: and the Apostle forbiddeth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the rule, but the corrupt manner of rule, ouer the Church. Lastly, it is plaine, that the word lording is a Metaphor, taken from euill and vnciuill, ciuill lords, and applied to the Ministers of the Church, forbidding them, so to raigne and rule ouer Gods flocke, as euill lords raigne ouer their flocke. But heere let vs a little examine this point. What? doth the Apostle here forbid that rule of the Primitiue Church, that else where is permitted? And it is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aine, that he doth not; how then? doth hee forbid the Elders to rule their flocke aright, &amp; withall vprightnes, as godly lords rule ouer their subiect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? no neither: how then? Doth he forbid the Elders to rule the Church with the ciuill sword, as godly Lords rule their flocke? if this be the sinne that the Apostle forbiddeth to the Elders; then of this sinne, are not our Bishops guiltie. Who gouerne the Church by the Ecclesiasticall, and not by the ciuill sword: what is it then? Surely, the Apostle forbiddeth the Elders of the Church, so to rule their flocke: as euill Lords, rule their people; but how doe euill lords rule their people? Surely thus, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund others to giue to the poore; but themselues will giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: they informe others to keepe the law; but they breake it themselues: they by maine power, and by very force compell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doe well: but by no godly example of life. Now thus to gouerne and to rule the flocke, the Apostle forbiddeth the Elders of the Church, and chargeth them, not to goe about by the meere Discipline of the Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thereunto, and therefore to lording ouer the flocke, which he forbiddeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the example of godly life: which hee commaundeth; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> therefore, by the opposition of godly exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ple, to lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer the flocke, wee may (as by the contrary) see, what is meant, by lording it ouer the heritage of the Lord: and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:27728:51"/> the true sence of the place, let vs see, how out of this sence, they can draw an argument, to ouerthrow the honor, and lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships of Bishops.</p>
               <p>And therefore to conclude this point, I reason thus, if a Lord Temporall (which I thinke no man will denie) may be made a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and yet hold his Lordship: then may Ecclesiasticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and ciuill Lordship stand together. If he may be first a Lord, and then created a Minister: then may he be first a Minister, and after created a Lord.</p>

               <p>And thus as it appeareth, hath the king giuen ouerseers, and rulers ouer the Church: and indued them lawfully with riches, and titles honourable: but the question is, whither God, beside the ordinary ministers, euer gaue ouerseers, and rulers ouer the Church? if he hath, then the next question is, what their office is, and how fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And for mine own part, this I hold; and meane by Gods grace to proue: that God neuer left his Church, without generall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers, and rulers ouer the Church: that is, ouer the standing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and people of the Church: and so by consequent, that an ouerseer, or Bishop of the Church, hath his standing, and place in the Church, as good, and euery way as allowable, and approued of God as euer the ruling Elders had.</p>
               <p>And heere before I enter into the proofe of mine opinion, it is needfull, that first we should agree about the name of a Bishop, or the ouerseer of the Church: and to dispatch this in a word, a Bishop in the Scripture phrase, is put for the ordinary Pastors of the Church; but in our phrase, it is put for the ouerseer, or ruler of the Church: that is, for such a one, as hath a speciall interest in

If we agree about the matter: I loue not to contende about the name, and here I meane to prooue first, that euer God gaue ouerseers to his Church, and neuer left it free, from superior rule, and that it is a matter conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to follow the forme, and patterne that God gaue to his Church, for the Gouernment thereof, in this point. Secondly that the Gouerners, and ouerseers that God gaue, weare altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same nature, and had the same power ouer the Church that our Bishops haue.</p>
               <p>And now to proue that God gaue ouerseers to his Church, I alleage, the manifest, &amp; expresse example of the spirit of God, that first gaue Apostles to take vpon them the care, and Gouernement of all the Churches. Yea then, when the Churches were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, both with sufficient Pastors, and with ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As appeareth by the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> that being from the Church of Corinth, reprooueth the Church there; for suffering among them that incestuous, and offensiue man: and ouer-ruleth them by his authoritie, and commaundeth them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with himselfe, to cast him out of the Church of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this more euidently appeareth, in that the Apostles, in their absence, set <hi>Titus</hi> ouer the whole countrey of Crete: and <hi>Timothie</hi> ouer the whole Ephesian Church: and so it appeareth, that in the dayes of the Primitiue Church, ouer-seers had their place and standing, in the Church of God, by the apointment and ordinance of God himselfe. Now if such a Gouernment were, by the very confession of our aduersaries, such a Gouernement ought to be now. If such Gouernours to vse our aduersaries rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) by God were giuen his Church: such Gouernours ought to be giuen to our Church now. For the Church euer being, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernous of the Church must of necessitie euer be.</p>
               <p>But to take away this plaine, and manifest example of God, and proofe of ours; they haue no other escape, nor st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:27728:52"/> but onely to alleage: that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> were Euangelists, and that by vertue onely of that calling, they held the ouerseeing power, and generall rule ouer whole Churches. But now, they simply, and truely hold that, those gifts are taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men of the Church: and therefore, they falsly inferre, that for want of those gifts, the Bishoplike office, is perished out of the Church.</p>
               <p>In which answere of theirs, there are as many vntruths, as there be full periods. The first whereof is, that <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothie,</hi> did hold the ouersight of those Churches, by vertue of their Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall functions. For the Apostles, that were not Euangelists, held it as well as the Euangelists did: and againe, the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists hold it, as well as the Apostles did: which argueth, that it appertaineth not to either of them, by vertue onely of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent callings: for then it must haue beene kept proper to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and seuerall, as their callings were: and not made common to both, but being by the Apostle set ouer, to the Euangelists, it is plaine, that it was proper to neither of their callings; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to more.</p>
               <p>To be an Euangelist, is to be free; and to follow the steps of the Apostles: and to build further, by the preaching of the Gospell; and not as ouerseers of some larger Churches to bee perpetually affixed thereunto. But it is plaine, that <hi>Timothie</hi> was affixed to the Ephesian Church; and if he were euer remoued, let our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries (against the testimonie of the auncient, and vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Church, that is, to the end of that Epistle to <hi>Timothie</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed) shewe that: but heere I must admonish them, that if they intend to shew that, they must bring better reasons, and proofes, then to shewe, that <hi>Timothie</hi> was afterward sent for by <hi>Paul.</hi> For the sending for him to come to <hi>Paul,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth no more, the remoouing of him, from his affixed place: then to send for the Bishoppe of Saint Andrewes to the court, argueth the putting him out of his Bishopricke there.</p>
               <p>It is in reason to bee thought, that <hi>Timothie</hi> so excellent an Euangelist, and of so long standing in his calling, knewe before hee was affixed to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> what did appertaine to his Euangelicall office. But what did appertaine to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Ephesian Church, he sufficiently knew not, before the Apostle, with a new doctrine, and new rules,
<pb facs="tcp:27728:53"/> for the new place had furnished him: &amp; therfore he writeth vnto him saying; these things, haue I wrote vnto thee, that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test know how to behaue thy selfe in the Church of God: that is in the Gouernment, and rule of the Church of God. <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>go,</hi> he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him precepts for the Gouernment of Gods Church: which was to <hi>Timothie</hi> a new, and other office, then the Euangelicall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was, wherein he was so well experienced before.</p>
               <p>And yet further, that this was the standing calling of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop put vpon him, for his whole life, I argue: because <hi>Paul</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him precepts for his particular behauiour there: chargeth him, saying, I charge thee before the Lord Iesus, keepe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement without blame, and spot to the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ: that is at the least, to <hi>Timothies</hi> dying day. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that he giueth to <hi>Timothie,</hi> and in him, to the Church perpetuall, and euerlasting rules to proceede by, in the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church: which I thinke that our aduersaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues will not, nor cannot denie. Thirdly, for that sitting there, the Apostle writeth vnto him a second Epist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, (being now the second time to answere at Rome, before <hi>Nero,</hi> which was a very little before his death) and chargeth him to looke to that his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> or office, in trust committed vnto him. 2. Tim. 1.14.15.16.17.18. And the subscription to the Epistle. 2. Tim. 4.6. All which argueth a long time of his sitting ouer the Ephesian Church, there he sat when <hi>Paul</hi> went to Macedonia, and there he sat, when <hi>Paul</hi> was to die at Rome. 2 Tim. 1.18. with the 2. Tim. 4.19. and 2.14.15.16. Fourthly, for that, if his placing there, had bene onely to adde some things left imper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ect, and so to haue left the Church, to the other officers of the Church, as the Pastors and Elders: in a short time, he might haue dispatched this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and followed the Apostles steps. But the Apostle giueth him charge to ouersee the life, and the doctrine of the setled Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors: and therefore though the Pastors, and Eldership were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; yet ouer them still, was <hi>Timothie</hi> to abide an ouerseer: and not vpon the setling of them, to depart: and therefore there could no iust cause of his after remoue be alleaged, which was not euen then in being, when yet it appeareth that he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued at all. And so it appeareth, that he had not the wandring function put vpon him of an Euangelist: but altogether a newe office, which was the standing office of a Bishop, as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to the Epistle calleth him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27728:53"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timothie</hi> was set to ouersee the Church of Ephesus; therefore he executed this office of his, as an ouerseer of the Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus: but the office of an Euangelist is one, and the office of a Bishop, is an other; differing therefrom. For if the office of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist, and the office of a Bishop be all one, then so many suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Bishops as we haue; so many Euangelists we haue: but we may let you easily see, and meane afterward, so to doe, that wee haue many suficient Bishops, for the ouersight of the Church: we should therefore haue so many Euangelists, which I hope our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries will neuer graunt the king: a temporall Lord, set by the king; a superintendant, set by the reformed Church: are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ouerseers of the Church; and yet no Euangelists I hope. It followeth therefore, that an Euangelist, and an ouerseer of the Church, be different offices. It thē they be different offices, &amp; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> did execute his office, at Ephesus, as an ouerseer, then hee did not execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it, as an Euangelist; as falsely our aduersaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our former argument.</p>
               <p>The second error <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n their answere is, that this ouersi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ht of the Church, being tyed to the greater callings, is perished with them: all which opinion of theirs, is vtterly false. For the greatest gifts dwelt in the Apostles, in whō was first set this gouerning power: the lesser gifts, were in the Euangelists, in whō also this gouerning power after dwelt: and therefore, necessarily, and plainely, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre from thence: that this gouerning power, is not proper onely to the greatest gifts, but common to these of lesser mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Secondly euen in these dayes of ours, there are men sufficient ynough, and very able, to performe all that the Apostle in <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> requireth to the ouersight of the Church: which what it is, we meane to shew in our answere to the next question: if then there be in our Church, men of sufficient gifts, for the execution of the ouerseers office: then how is this function perished, as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries say, for want of sufficient gifts? For there being able, and sufficient gifts, for that office: I cannot see, that an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, or that gifs more then sufficient, are of necessitie required thereunto.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hauing the patterne of the Primitiue Gouernement giuen vs, and the gifts not giuen vs: I thinke it better, and more safe, to keepe the patterne, though we haue lost the gifts: which is to keepe one, when we cannot haue both: then hauing lost the
<pb facs="tcp:27728:54"/> gifts, to cast away the patterne, &amp; so, because we cannot haue that one, to cast away both: and that it is more true wisdome, to keepe in our Church, the patterne that God gaue, without the gifts: then with the want, ot the losse of the gifts: to loose, &amp; to want, the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and resemblance, of the Gouernment of God, and that it is better to proportion ours to that; and to come vnto it as neere as we can: though we cannot fully shole it, and match it euery way.</p>
               <p>And thus doth our argument, taken from the Patterne of the Primitiue Church, stand firme, and sure; their cauelling reply to the contrary notwithstanding: &amp; thus haue we, by a particular &amp; manifest ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mple, that cannot be denied, taken from the word of God, plainely proued, that ouerseers, &amp; Bishops, were by God, giuen to the Primitiue Church. Now it is not in reason to bee thought, but that (these Bishops, <hi>Timothy</hi> I meane, and <hi>Titus,</hi> liuing &amp; dying, in the midst of the Church) the Church would inquire, and aske of them the will of God, concerning their succession; &amp; cōcerning the perpetuity of the office, that they bore, &amp; that they resolued the Church, that the will of God was, that others after them should sit in their seat: and hold the helme, as they did in all the dayes of their life, of the troubled, and persecuted Church of Christ, &amp; that by their appointment, successors were decreed, and agreed on. For I dare not perswade my selfe, that either the church then, being in his sincerity, would be so carelesse, or negligent, as not to inquire of this point, hauing the opportunity of an Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, to giue them an answere: or so bold, &amp; peruerse, as contrary to the resolution of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to set vp in his place, an ouerseer to succeed after him. But what do we need, to run to reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, when we haue an expresse commaundent to <hi>Timothy,</hi> for doing so? For <hi>Paul,</hi> that charged <hi>Timothy</hi> in his first Epistle, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. to keepe that which of trust was committed vnto him: that is, the sincere Gouernment, and doctrine of the Church: againe, in his second Epistle (to let the world know, that the same office at the time of his second Epistle, was still in the hand of <hi>Timothie</hi>) remembreth vnto him the speciall care afore commaunded, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim,</hi> 1.14. Keepe the excellent thing that thou art put in trust with. And a few words after, he addeth, saying, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. What thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, those things commit to faithful men, which are fit also to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. So that it is plain, that it was commanded vnto <hi>Timothie,</hi> to set ouer the thing, in trust committed vnto him, to others,
<pb facs="tcp:27728:54"/> that are fit, and able men. But the thing in trust committed to <hi>Timothie,</hi> was the Gouernement of the Church, and the doctrine of Christ. The ouersight therefore of the Church, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere doctrine of Christ, was by commaundement of God, to be set ouer by <hi>Timothie</hi> to others: able and fit men, not onely to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne (for that must bee vnderstood by his relatiue also) but also to teach others: and what can bee more plaine then this, to the proouing of a succession of Bishoppes, after <hi>Timothie,</hi> I cannot see.</p>
               <p>And yet farther, to argue the vse, and gift of Bishops vnto the Church; I vse the like reason, that our aduersaries vsed, for the prouing of the perpetuitie of their ruling Elders, and I reason thus: that officer that by God is set into the Church, and hath there his gifts described, his office at large defined, hath his place of God, in the Church of God: But an ouerseer, or Bishop, in the person of <hi>Timothie,</hi> was set into the Church by God: and he hath in the word, his gifts, and his office, at large expressed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the whole Epistle of <hi>Timothie: Ergo,</hi> an ouerseer, or a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, hath his place, in the Church of God, by God.</p>
               <p>Againe, the office of <hi>Timothie,</hi> was to ouersee the Church (namely of Ephesus:)</p>
               <p>But the office of <hi>Timothie,</hi> did not die with <hi>Timothie: ergo,</hi> the office of ouerseeing the Church, did not die with <hi>Timothie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the office of <hi>Timothy</hi> had beene to die with <hi>Timothie,</hi> is it like that the spirit, to shewe an office of so short continuance, would haue indited an Epistle, of so great a length: &amp; haue giuen it to the Church, as a parcell of Gods word, that indureth for euer?</p>
               <p>If the office of <hi>Timothie,</hi> being set out in a particular Epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> was made priuate, and particular to <hi>Timothie</hi> onely, and not common to more: then the other offices of the Church, by the same particular Epistle established, and appointed to be created, and ouerseene by <hi>Timothie,</hi> are to die, and to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with him: the offices then of the Elders, the Pastors, the Deacons; the Widdowes, that were to be erected, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by <hi>Timothie,</hi> must die with <hi>Timothie;</hi> when beside <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> after his death, none such may arise that hath like power, as hee had, to ordaine, to create, to erect, and ouersee such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and such offices. For the creating cause being taken away: the creature it selfe, must needes bee taken away also with it.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27728:55"/>
               <p>The Apostle speaketh to <hi>Tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thie</hi> the ouerseer of the Church, concerning the fit gifts of himselfe, being to ouersee the Church, 1. Ti. 6.14. &amp; saith, I charge thee in the sight of God, who quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all things, that thou keep the commandement without spot, &amp; blame, vntill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ. But how could <hi>Timothy,</hi> that was to the before the comming of Iesus Christ, keepe that commandement till the comming of Iesus Christ: and therefore, that it might be perpetuall, and till that time obserued, it must bee obserued of a <hi>Timothie:</hi> not in name, but in nature: not in the person, but in the office and succession of <hi>Timothie:</hi> that can make onely this rule perpetuall, to the comming of Christ. But the nature, the office, and succession of <hi>Timothie:</hi> was the nature, the office, and the succession of ouerseers: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to keepe that commaundement, till the day of the Lord. And therefore, if that commaundement implieth in it the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Gouernement, and chargeth the perpetuitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as some of our aduersaries haue vnderstood it: then as it char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the perpetuity of the Gouernment, so the perpetuity of the person, that must keepe the Gouernement; and the person that must keepe it, was the ouerseer, or Bishop of the Church: whom yet our aduersaries would throw out of the Church, and retaining the rule, cast out the ruler; and so vse, and refuse, at their pleasure; what pleased their owne humour: but vpon what reason let the reader iudge.</p>
               <p>In the Church which is the best estate, there must not be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraty, which is the worst estate:</p>
               <p>But where ouerseers are taken out of the Church, and all are left in an equallitie of power: there is a democratie, or a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar state:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> ouerseers must not be taken away out of the Church.</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer good order requireth in the Church, that must be there:</p>
               <p>But good order requireth a prioritie in calling, and a Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer a body: whither Naturall, Politique, or Ecclesiasticall:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> such a calling, such a Gouernement, and such Gouernors must be there.</p>
               <p>In all ages since Christ, the Ministers of the Church haue had their ouerseers: in the time of Christ, Christ held it ouer his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; in the dayes of the Apostles, the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:27728:55"/> Church, all their dayes: and after them, the godly Bishops, that were the most notable and choice men of all ages, held it, vntill this day of ours: and had this bene so vnlawfull a calling, and so Antichristian, as our aduersaries hold it, would Iesus Christ haue held it? would the Apostles, Euangelists, the Martyrs, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of all ages, haue held it, so many hundred yeeres together? or must now the Ministers bee set free: that so many ages of the world, haue euer beene vnder the Gouernement, of superior Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops?</p>
               <p>God hath giuen ouerseers to his Church, the King giueth ouerseers to the Church: themselues set vp superintendents ouer the Church: and yet must ouerseers, or Bishops needes be taken away from out of our Church?</p>
               <p>But I hope, that by this time, they see their error: I leaue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prosecute this point, and I come to see, what manner of Bishops they were, that God gaue to his Church: and how farre their office did extend it selfe.</p>
               <p>And this we may best see, in <hi>Timothie,</hi> whom God gaue an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urch: and in the Epistles to <hi>Timothie,</hi> which for that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rpose were specially written, by the holy Ghost, and left as teachers for euer vnto the Church, to let the Church know, what the office and duetie is, of the ouerseers of the flocke of Christ.</p>
               <p>And first in those Epistles, I plainely see, and it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were by their calling, preachers of the word, and so to doe, haue a speciall charge giuen them by the spirit of God. 2. Tim. 4.1.2. An ouerseer therfore, or a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Church, by his calling, must be a Minister, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the Mysterers of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching his life, he must be an ensample of the flocke in word in conuersation, in charity, in the spirit, in faith, in puritie. 1. Tim 4.12.13. and 6.11.12. He must follow piety, faith, loue. patience, and meekenesse: he must fight the good fight of faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as concerning his exercises, he must giue attendance to reading, 1. Tim. 4.13. but bodily exercise, as that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth but little, he must but little vse.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as concerning his office, to gouerne the Church: it stretcheth it selfe partly ouer the vnder officers of the Church: and partly ouer the people. His office ouer the vnder officers, is either ouer the preachers of the word; or ouer the others that
<pb facs="tcp:27728:56"/> preach not the word: the other officers that preach not the word, are either men or women, bearing office in the Church: the men are Elders and Deacons, the women are the aged widdowes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all which, (excepting the lay Elder) the Apostle instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth <hi>Timothie,</hi> what manner of persons they must be, that must by <hi>Timothie,</hi> to those functions be chosen: &amp; what care is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the choice of them: and this is the first part of the Bishops office, to make a fit choice of able, and sufficient men, to occupie those roomes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee is to haue a speciall stroke in the creation of Ministers, lay hands, saith the Apostle, rashly vpon no man. 1. Tim. 5.22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, being once created ministers, he is first to looke to their doctrine, that they teach not peruerse, and false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: that they teach not fables, and genealogies. 1. Tim. 1.3.4. Especially, that about indifferent things, as meate, and marriage, they teach not that vnsound, and false doctrine, that was foretold by the spirit, to be broached in the latter dayes. 1. Tim. 4.3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they must see, that Ministers make prayers, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and thankesgiuing, for all sorts of men: especially, for kings, and Princes. 1. Tim. 2.1.2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he must looke vnto the life of the Ministers, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them if they be found in fault: receiue no accusation against an Elder, saith the Apostle, vnder two, or three witnesses. 1. Tim 5.19.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if the Ministers labour in the word, and are faithfull, he must see that due honour, and maintenance be giuen vnto them, the Elders that rule well, saith the Apostle, are worthy of double honor, especially, such as labor in the word, and doctrine. 1. Tim. 5.17.18. And these are his particular dueties, in regard of the Church Ministers: <hi>Ergo,</hi> here is an ouerseer of the Ministers, a Bishop of Bishops.</p>
               <p>In the next place he is to looke vnto the peace of the Church, if any man, saith the Apostle, teacheth diuerse doctrine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not vnto the sound doctrine of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to the doctrine that is according vnto godlines: he swelleth, and knoweth nothing, but is mad about questions, and the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of words. 1. Tim. 6.3.4.5. Whereby riseth enuie, euill spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, euill suspicions, peruerse practises, of men corrupted in mind, &amp; which are depriued of the truth, and make gaine of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, depa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t from such.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27728:56"/>
               <p>Sixtly, he must looke vnto good order, and vnto comelinesse in the Church. I permit not a woman, saith the Apostle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>But the greatest matter of doubt is, whither the Bishop might censure the offending Christians, that liued vnder the Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of seuerall Elderships, &amp; vnder the power of their standing, and their ordinary Pastor. And for my part, I plainely see, from the doctrine, and practise of <hi>Paul:</hi> that <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> had a gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Tim. 6.17.18.19. and 6.1.2. Them that sinne, saith the Apostle, reproue openly, that the rest may feare. 1. Tim. 5.20. If he may openly reproue the open sinner, I make no question, but that he might also punish them, if the case so require, with excommunication. Exhort, improoue, rebuke, saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> 2.15. with all authoritie: but without the administration of the censures, he could not withall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rebuke: the vse of thē. Therfore, was permitted vnto <hi>Titus.</hi> An Heretick after the first, or second admonition, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> eschew. Tit. 3.10. Knowing that such a one sinneth, being damned of himselfe: he giueth him in those words expresly, power, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate Heretiques: if any man teacheth diuerse doctrine, saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie,</hi> as we cited the place before, him eschew: he giueth in like manner to <hi>Timothie,</hi> authoritie, to cast out of the Church by excommunication, the Schismaticke, and the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some man: and yet this is made plaine, by the practise of <hi>Paul:</hi> that of himselfe deliuered vnto Sathan, <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> that they might learne not to blaspheme. 1. Tim. 1.20. And yet is it made more plaine by his proceeding against the incestuous person, among the Corinthians. Of whom <hi>Paul</hi> hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by common report, determineth thus, saying: For I vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, haue determined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, as though I were present, that he that hath done this thing, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that such a one, I say, by the power of our Lord Iesus Christ, be deliuered vnto Sathan: where wee plainely see, that <hi>Paul</hi> the generall ouerseer of the Church, being absent, ioyneth with the Eldership, in casting out, that incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, giueth them commandement to do it; and first pronounceth

               <p>And thus not running to the fathers, which are but the lesser stre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>seer of the Primitiue Church: yet safe, and pure, and without all spot, &amp; blot of humane corruption. Now what Christian heart is there, that considering all these parts, so specially, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly deliuered, can once thinke or perswade it selfe, that all this was written for one <hi>Timothie,</hi> or for one <hi>Titus</hi> onely, and for no more: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing God? and that onely for the guiding of one or two men, and for no more, was all this scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inspired by God? and that it serued for no after age for euer? or who rather doth not beleeue, that to this end, was all this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to teach for euer vnto the Church, what is the office, and the dutie of the ouerseers of the Church, that should in all ages of the world spring vp for euer.</p>
               <p>And now out of all this, it appeareth: first, that the gifs, the calling, and the office of a Bishop, is particularly, &amp; at large desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered by the holy Scriptures, inspired by God: &amp; that this was another office, then the office of the Euangelelist was: namely, the office of a Bishop, or the office of an ouerseer of the Church; and the selfe same office, that of trust is committed to our Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bishops, the ouerseers of the English Church. O could our aduersaries, out of the Scriptures of God, shew the office of their ruling Elder, thus particularly and plainely, at large described: How would they triumph, and conclude, that he was set into the Church by God; that he had his place, his office, and his calling, at large giuen him by the power of our Lord Iesus Christ: and therefore that he was to abide for euer in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this being the office of a Bishop, it is apparent, as I sayd before; that for the execution hereof, there is no necessity
<pb facs="tcp:27728:57"/> of the gifts of an Euangelist: or of the Apostles of Iesus Christ, and that God in mercy, hath giuen to our Church, many excellent men, that for gifts are made able, and sufficient to bare and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute this ouerseers office.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the office of a Bishop, giuen by God, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a superintendent giuen by the reformed Churches, is not all one: &amp; that God neuer gaue, as our aduersaries fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, Titular Bishops, that is Bishops, in title, and name: but not Bishops in office, and power: such as our Bishops be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that Bishops are no Antichristian creation: but that they had their first ordinance, and institution of God: and that had they kept themselues, within the compasse that was set them by God, there had bene no feare, of a Pope, to spring out of their of-spring: But ranging out of their stinted place, and adding to Bishops, Patriarkes, and Cardinals: and to those adding Popes: out of the addition of man, and not out of the creation of Bishops, which were of God, Antichrist sprung vp: by the principall, if not onely helpe of Ecclesiasticall Discipline retained, vsed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abused by the Pope: powers therfore, in, and of the Church, aboue the Bishops of the Church, the Church of God neuer knew neither was it lawfull, sith God gaue B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shops, for the Church to giue Patriarkes, or Popes. No the ordinance, and the patterne of God, is closely to be sticked vnto, &amp; it was not lawful to go an inch frō the example of God, in setting vp ouerseers, ouer the Church.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that the office of a Bishop, all the daye of the persecuted Church at the least, had his perpetuall, &amp; necessary place, in the Church of God In which time he sat as a king, in the want of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian kings, to gouerne the whole Church, that was vnder him. And euen now in the dayes of Christian kings, he hath as good, if not far better place, by God giuen him in the Church, thē the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elder hath: and sith it hath pleased the kings Maiesty, when he might vtterly haue banished the discipline Ecclesiastical, to let it, (it being first made fit for his kingdome) haue his seat, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within this kingdome of his: I see no reason, why the other parts therof should be left in vse, and the ouerseers of the Church, the principall part thereof, be discontinued, and banished out of the land. The reformed Churches therefore, by cutting away of Bishops, haue made a maime in the body of Christ, and haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, and to halfes retained, and set vp the Primitime Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Church.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:27728:58"/>
               <p>And heere, least my arguments as a loose broome, should not sweepe cleane, and carry all before them, I will fasten them a litle closer, and presse them into a few short, and plaine conclusions. Where first I will lay downe this, as the ground of the rest, that the office of <hi>Timothie,</hi> (which I will proue to be the office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) is perpetuall. I meane to the persecuted, yea &amp; to the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Church: so farre forth, as is requisite for the creating, and for the well gouerning of the created ministery: though not for the gouerning of the people; which I hold as the rest of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Gouernment, vnder a Christian king, to be altogether ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary. For there euer being a ministery to teach, though not to gouerne the people: I hold a necessitie of a Bishop to create, and to gouerne this ministery: which indeed was the principall office of <hi>Timothie,</hi> though I thinke that at the first, and in the persecuted church, he had a speciall stroke in the gouernment of the people, as our Bishops haue at this day: and my arguments for the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I alleage this reason to let them see how partiall they are, that can make at their pleasure some words, for their owne aduantage, particular, that are generall: and some againe of the same nature for their aduantage, generall, that are particular.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:27728:59"/> whither it was the office of the Euangelist, is the maine question: but I will out of all question take away that question, by this argument.</p>

So that the Bishops had their first place of God: but now they haue it of the king also; &amp; so there is some thing of the Bishop, that was of God: and that is their first institution, and creation: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is of the king; and that is their Baronies, and their power also, to rule in steed of the king, ouer the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. We therefore, that haue subscribed to the booke of the ordination of Bishops and Deacons haue subscribed only to the ordinance, and to the institution of God, and the king: and so we haue committed no euill, nor done any sinne at all, in that out of so good grounds of the word of God, we haue subscribed first to the ordination of Bishops: and by consequent, to the establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Gouernment of this our Church: which we haue shewed to come more neare to the Primitiue Gouernement, which was in
